NOTE: Management stories take place in early !-era spring, so they're a good gauge for relationships pre-development.

    Season: Early Spring [!]

With Kuro

    Location: Library


Kiryu? It’s rare to see you in a place like this. What are you doing

Oh, danna. You came at a good time. Couldja tell me what this word means?

English reference books..? Were you studying?

 Yeah. Actually, Kanzaki asked me a question about English grammar the other day. It was something I could answer, but…
Seems like he’s unbelievably bad at English. Did you know about that, danna?

No… He has a serious disposition, so I was under the impression he could study just as diligently.
Come to think of it, there are times where he struggles with English words we use on a daily basis.

 Right? Seems he can handle other subjects better than average, but English is the one thing he just can&#39;t do.
Seein’ him like that got me worried, but I&#39;m not that good at studying myself. That’s how I ended up here, reviewin’ it.

I see… I’m starting to get worried, too… I don’t think it’ll affect his grades, but still…
Okay. I have some reference books and vocabulary flashcards I can recommend, so stay here. I’ll bring them.

Alright, thanks. It&#39;s reassurin&#39; to know you’re willin’ to help us out, danna.

With Tsukasa

    Location: School Store


There’s no urgent work today. Now and again, I have lunch at the school store, so I thought I’d come by, but…
Why is there nothing but soybean bread left?
The sign says “Now half-off the regular price!&#39;&#39;, but there’s still so much left over… As I figured, it’s not very popular.
I don&#39;t like soybeans either. It&#39;s not something I’m going to force myself to eat. It&#39;s a pain, but I have no choice but to go to the cafeteria.

Oh, Hasumi-senpai? Hello. The bread in the school store is exquisite. I also come here quite often.

Suou? . . I don&#39;t want to eat soybean bread, even if it’s exquisite.
From what I see, you seem to have bought a different kind of bread. I can’t believe you managed to buy them in time.

As soon as the bell rang to signal the end of class, I headed straight to the school store.
The first year’s classrooms are close to the school store, so if you walk quickly, you can buy the popular bread ♪
Um, Hasumi-senpai. If you don&#39;t like the bread there, do you want to exchange it for the bread I bought?

Is that okay…? It would help. To be honest, it’s not that they’re inedible: I just really don&#39;t like soybeans. I was just thinking about going to the cafeteria instead.

I see, so Hasumi-senpai doesn&#39;t like soybeans. From now on, I will refrain from giving you anything with soybeans in it.
But why is there so much surplus today? Is it a purchase order Mistake?

Who knows... Suou, I&#39;m starting to feel a little sick, so I&#39;ll wait outside.
Jeez, I don&#39;t think I can ever overcome soybeans.

With Mao

    Location: Cafe


Mm. This coffee is delicious.

Hm… There aren’t any seats left. I guess it can’t be helped… I’ll check another store.

Isara…? I didn’t expect to meet you in a place like this.
The seat in front of me is empty, so why don&#39;t you sit down?

Oh, vice president? ! Um, is that okay? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m meeting someone.

I&#39;m alone, so it’s fine. I’m ordering a refill of coffee, but what about you, Isara?

Well, it&#39;s the same for me... Um, do you come to this store often?

Not really. I only come every once in a while whenever I feel like drinking coffee.
Well, usually I have Japanese tea, though... What? Even if you look at me like that, I won&#39;t let you have my chiffon cake.

A-Ah, it’s not that– Er… There&#39;s just something unusual to me about the vice president having cake.

Hmph, even I eat something like this once in a while. Putting that aside, it seems that what I asked for has arrived.
It&#39;s normal for the student council to be busy, so it&#39;s important to take breaks.
It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other, so it&#39;d be nice to take our time catching up over coffee.

With Yuzuru

    Location: Archery Hall


I’m coming in.

Ah, Hasumi-sama. Are you participating in the archery club&#39;s activities today?

Yes. I finished my student council work early, so I thought I’d show up for once.
Judging from appearances, it’s just you Fushimi. Were you practicing alone?

No. I was simply cleaning.

Ahh, I’m grateful that you do this without me having to ask.
It’s thanks to you that the archery range is kept tidy, Fushimi. You have my thanks.

There’s no need to thank me. I&#39;m a member of the archery club, and cleaning is my hobby.
Hasumi-sama, the only thing I have left to do is clean the floor… Could you please wait in the changing room until it&#39;s finished?
However, I&#39;d feel terrible to keep you waiting, so I&#39;ll prepare something for you to drink afterwards.

Hey, I’m not a customer. We’re both members of the archery club, so let me help with the cleaning, too.

But I cannot allow Vice President-sama himself to do such a thing．

I told you to call me by my last name during club activities. I’m also a member of the archery club, so we’ll do the cleaning together.
Besides, the sooner we do it, the sooner it will be over. Let&#39;s put in some elbow grease every now and then.

With Kaoru

    Location: Rooftop


Hakaze, you&#39;ve come at the right time. I have something to talk to you about．

Mm, well I don&#39;t, so cut me a break please~ Your lectures are too long, Hasumi-kun, so I don’t really care for them.

Hmph, it&#39;s your own fault for doing things that need lecturing.
Hakaze, you’ve been leaving your surfboard here without permission, haven’t you? Take it home immediately.

Well, it&#39;s the perfect place for air-drying it~ It’s not like it’s bothering anyone if I hang it out here, so it&#39;s fine, right?

It’s not fine. We’ve been telling students not to store personal items on campus without permission.

Yeah, yeah. You’re not very accommodating, are you Megane-kun~?

Who are you calling &quot;Megane-kun&quot;? If you really want to store it on the roof, take the appropriate steps…

Look, let’s put that aside, have you seen Transfer student-chan, Hasumi-kun?

The transfer student? No, I haven&#39;t. Did you need something from her?

Yeah, kinda~ But if she isn&#39;t here, there&#39;s no point sticking around the rooftop anymore. I&#39;ll be going. Bye bye~

Wait, Hakaze, this conversation isn&#39;t over!
Hey, don’t ignore me! Listen to people when they’re talking to you!1

With Madara

    Location: Student Council Room


……

Excuse meeee~!

Uwaa, you startled me?! Hey, Mikejima! Knock before you enter a room!

Hahaha, you sound a liiittle like Shu-san.
Aaanyways, your smartphone slipped out of your hand Keito-san.
I grabbed it right before it hit the floor so I don’t think it broke, but… Please check just to be sure!

…… Ah, it’s fine.
Since you picked it up for me, I should at least show my gratitude. Thank you, Mikejima.

You don’t need to thank meee. Aaanyway, I caught a glimpse of your screen when I picked it up. You read books on your phone, huh, Keito-san?

I do so every once in a while, yes. Hardcovers are too heavy to carry around, so I just read them as e-books sometimes, that’s all.
More importantly, you came to the student council room for business, right Mikejima?
What did you need? It’s just me right now, but I can handle almost anything you need on my own.

Well, here. I created a live proposal, so I was hoping you would check to see if it’s good enough!

Hmm… Do you mind if it takes a little while? I want to review it properly.

No problem at aaall~ While I&#39;m waiting, I&#39;d like to read the book you were reading earlier, Keito-san. Could you tell me the title of it?
From the sentence I read earlier, it seemed interesting. Consider me intrigued.

Ah, if you like, I don’t mind if you read it on my phone.
It’ll have to be later, but when I get home I can grab my paperback and lend it to you.
I doubt you’re the type to hold back, but let me know what you think about it.

Hanafuda Chapter 1

    Season: Winter


    Location: 2-A Classroom


Excuse me, I’m coming in.

Good Afternoon, Lieutenant Vice President. 1
Do you have business with Class-2A?

Don’t call me that, it makes me sound like I’m in the yakuza. I’m aware that you hate me, but you’ll have an easier life if you concealed your malice a little more.

Yes, yeS, I don&#39;t want a lecture…
But it&#39;s really unusual for you to come to our classroom, isn’t iT? Since you&#39;re such a distinguished vice president, why don&#39;t you just invite the underclassmen to your citadeL?

I have an errand for a guy who doesn&#39;t have the means for me to call him, so I have to walk there myself, don’t I?

AhhH… So you’re here for Sohma-kuN?2 That boy doesn’t carry a phone with him– a pretty rare habit these dayS.
That’s why there’s no choicE but to use old-fashioned means of communicatioN.

It helps that you’re quick to the point. Is Kanzaki here?

YeP. LooK, he’s playing in the corner of the classrooM.

Now, now, it’s about time for our match…☆

Hmm. He&#39;s unusually riled up, albeit befitting for a high school boy.
I&#39;m glad he’s having fun... He&#39;s an odd guy, so I was worried he&#39;d stand out like a sore thumb in class.

Ahaha. It&#39;s not unusual to see &quot;odd guys&quot; at Yumenosaki Academy nowadayS, since it&#39;s become a breathable environment, you knoW.
Especially for Sohma-kuN. He’s mellowed out since he became a second-yeaR.
Well, whateveR. I’d hate to see people think I’m buddy-buddy with the vice president because we talked for so lonG, so I&#39;M going to go noW.

Right, right, go off now. I&#39;m sorry for interrupting you as you were leaving the classroom, Sakasaki.

Don’t worrY, it was just bad timinG. No, it was bad lucK... I wonder if I&#39;ve contracted Senpai&#39;s misfortunE?

( ... There he goes. Peculiar as always, just what you&#39;d expect from a former member of the Five Eccentrics.)
(But before, every time we met, he’d harass me in some way, like hitting me with beans...)
(Compared to that, I feel that we&#39;ve been able to interact much more amicably.)

(I don’t think it means he’s forgiven us… But maybe it shows that Sakasaki is changing too.)
(I figured he was the type of person who had little room to grow, since he had such a high level of perfection to begin with, but look at him now.)

(Heheh. The good changes and remarkable improvement of the underclassmen always manages to surprise me.)


Alright! This Kanzaki Souma is the parent! I’ve finally got custody…☆

… Hm?

Hmhmm, my hand is quite excellent, too. This match shall be mine to take, Anzu-dono~♪

... Kanzaki. What is this, what are you and Anzu talking about? I may have to lecture you for an hour or so depending on the situation.

Oh, Hasumi-dono! What a surprise; what brings you all the way to my classroom?
In the event of an emergency, I’d have gone anywhere if you had simply called for me!

Even for me, I think it&#39;s inefficient to come find you every time I need you for something, but...
I don&#39;t have any other choice. No matter how many times I tell you to, you don&#39;t carry your smartphone on you.
Smartphones these days are easy to operate, even for people who aren’t accustomed to modern appliances. If you need it, Kiryu and I will teach you how to use it thoroughly.

Ahaha. A sermon right out the gate; that is truly just like you to do, Hasumi-dono.
Let us leave that aside for now; what really brought you here?

Mm. I’ve received a small job to do over the weekend… so I want you to come to the dojo after school today. Kiryu will be there, and I’d like to discuss the matter with all three of us present together.
But today was supposed to be a day off from AKATSUKI activities, so if you have other things to do, you can prioritize those.

A-ha. Right, I understand. I’m humbled by your concern, but I have no matter nor training to conduct today, so I can attend the meeting.

Is that right? That&#39;s good to hear. It’d be tiring to have to repeat the same explanation over and over again, so it’ll be easier if I do it all at once.
Well if that’s the case, I&#39;d like you to come to the dojo after school. I don’t mind if you take your time.

Understood. Ahh, I apologize profusely for making you come all the way here just for that.
However, considering how Hasumi-dono operates, I believe you could’ve chosen to call me by broadcast or the like.

Wouldn’t you hate that and say something like, “It’s disgraceful of me…”? Being called over school broadcast doesn’t give a good impression to those around you, after all.
It’s easier to walk to the second-year classroom than to ask a member of the Broadcasting Committee to call for you anyways, so don&#39;t worry about it too much, Kanzaki.

I feel like I gained something by seeing how you usually behave in the classroom. I’m glad to see you’re enjoying yourself much more than I had expected.

Hanafuda Chapter 2
I see. I was shocked to hear such a suspicious remark from you earlier, but now I understand... You were playing with hanafuda cards.
That&#39;s why you were talking about custody, right? Are you playing the ”koi koi” card game by any chance?

Having fun and making merry with classmates in the classroom is typical of high schoolers. But I feel like hanafuda card games as a choice of game are too complicated.

Hahaha, how embarrassing of me. I’m personally more familiar with this game than “Toranpu”, but…
It seems like everyone my age does not know how to play, which makes me feel a little lonely.

Adonisu-dono showed interest, so I taught him various things, but he still hasn’t memorized the “ruuru”.

…………

Hm, Otogari? Come to think of it, you’re in the same class as Kanzaki, and you’re close friends, aren’t you?

Ahh, Hasumi-senpai… Lend me your help. I’d like to play a hanafuda card game with Kanzaki and Anzu too, but the terminology is too complicated.

That’s not surprising. I also only understand the simplest and most familiar card game, “koi-koi”. But I haven&#39;t played it in a while, so I only vaguely remember the hand combinations.

Ahh, yes… No matter how many times the combinations are explained to me, I can&#39;t connect them to the words that I do know, so I look up the meaning of each word in a dictionary and write them down in my notebook.
Umm… This one with this one would be sakura ni makura... Which is “Cherry Blossom” and “Curtain Call”…?

You’re starting to sound like Suou, Otogari.

Uu… Oogami likes card games in general, so we usually play together… so I’m sure that if I could just remember the rules, I could play with you guys too.

Heheh. Adonisu-dono, you might not be confident with the language yet, but you’re quite clever, aren’t you?
So instead of getting trapped by the actual meaning of the terminology, I think it&#39;s better to memorize words through intuition by looking at them.
All hanafuda cards have pictures on them, so it&#39;s better to memorize them by the pictures than by the meanings of the words.
Generally, the more extravagant the picture, the stronger the card… or rather, the higher the score.
Here, this is a picture with the moon on top of a mountain, correct?
When you combine it with the sake card, you get the “moon-viewing with a drink” hand.
It&#39;s like having a glass of sake while looking at the moon: getting tipsy and feeling good.

This one is sake? So this red part wasn’t… erm, a UFO of some sort?

Hmm. It certainly does look like an unidentified flying object, but it&#39;s actually sake.

So, the object behind this strangely pessimistic-looking bird... Is it also sake?

Heheh. Since you know the meaning of “pessimistic”, you’ll surely be able to quickly memorize the words used in hanafuda.
By the way, this is the moon. A crescent moon, to be exact.

So this is also a moon…? Alright, when you combine this with the sake card, do you still get “moon-viewing with a drink”?

No. Unfortunately, it doesn’t become a legible hand unless the sake card is matched with this full moon card.

Difficult… Hanafuda is difficult…

Don’t say that, I’d like you to try your best to learn it.
There are games like “Hachi-hachi” that are meant to be played with three people, so if Adonisu-dono grows to understand hanafuda, it will be more fun.

Hahaha. Looks like you&#39;re having a hard time, Kanzaki.

No, no, talking with Adonisu-dono is beneficial for me as well.
I think that trying to explain difficult things in an understandable way also fits with AKATSUKI’s principles.
Like traditional performing arts… When it comes to things like Noh and Kabuki, many people don&#39;t understand the meaning of the words, and thus can’t understand the fun behind it.
We AKATSUKI will be the ones who translate and provide that “fun” in a modern way.
That is another one of AKATSUKI’s principles that I resonate with.
Even when I perform on stage for an event related to my household, I find it a shame that small children look at me in confusion, due to it being incomprehensible to them.

Mm, that sounds about right. At my temple, we try to explain the meaning of sutras in an understandable, modern way too.

Heheh. Born and raised in such a house, I believe Hasumi-dono truly is the linchpin of AKATSUKI’s founding principle.

… Oh, it isn’t really the time to casually chat, is it?
At this rate, we may not have time to cook, Anzu-dono.
So far, I’ve been in the lead this round, so is it alright if I&#39;m in charge of cooking today?

? What do you mean by that?

Mm. Anzu-dono and I often eat together at the cafeteria, choosing the “koosu” where we make the meal ourselves.
This is especially common when “Torikkusutaa” is away for work.

Ah, now that I think about it, there isn’t a noisy pack of guys hanging around. I guess they&#39;re busy taking their preparation seriously for SS.

Mhm. This time they seem to be doing a magazine interview that wasn’t organized by Anzu-dono, so she is left to “house-sit” in the school, so to speak.
But if she could, it seems like she’d like to accompany all of “Torikkusutaa”&#39;s activities.

Don’t. If you’re always hanging out with those guys, you won&#39;t be able to attend class properly.
Since they’re specifically out for a job, Trickstar is still considered as attending school, but for you, Anzu, it’d be considered as cutting classes under the rules.
It&#39;s not a good idea to end up in a situation like that vampire, where you have to repeat a grade because you didn’t attend enough days.

… Hm, the producer course will properly start from next school year onward, so the rules regarding attendance will need to be adjusted a bit.

    Season: Early Spring [!]

with Makoto

    Location: Hallway


(Nnh. It feels like the second year&#39;s floor has such a dignified atmosphere. I’ve only just changed one floor, how is it so different?)
(I can only hope I manage to conceal my presence until I reach Isara-dono&#39;s classroom…)

Huh? Shinobu-kun! What&#39;s the matter? Did you have business in the second-year classroom?

Y-Yuuki-dono!? Hold on, I was spotted almost immediately…!?

Ah, could it be that? You were training to walk without detection?
Well, there’s no wonder you’ve become a bit of a celebrity around here. I heard people say there’s a kid training as a ninja in our school, y’see~♪

Huh!? D-Do I really stand out that much?

Mhm, mhm. There aren&#39;t many kids who aspire to be ninjas, much less train like one.

Eeep, spare me~! I&#39;m not doing this to stand out at all… Or rather, I don&#39;t want to stand out!

Is that so? See, I was thinking of proposing a segment like “Blitz☆Yumenosaki Academy&#39;s Celebrities” for the next noon broadcast.
So I was hoping to ask you if you wanted to do an interview as well, y’know?

I-If that happens, I&#39;ll definitely disappear off the face of the earth for a while?

with Mao

    Location: Hallway


Isara-dono~☆ Look, look, the shuriken I ordered online came in!
When I saw they ran out, I came to terms with it and abandoned all hope — But when I checked the site just the other day, it was back in stock!
I used up my allowance on it because I had to get it right away.
Thanks to that, I’ll have to rely on hyorogan to make it through the month, but… I have no regrets! If anything, getting to see the real thing puts my excitement through the roof~♪

Ah, yeah, I get that you’re thrilled, but could I ask you to get off my stomach?
The pressure’s been hurting for a while. You jumped on me so suddenly, so I wasn’t able to brace myself.

Uwaa, are you hurt? I was so happy to get my shuriken and see Isara-dono, I lost my composure.

That sort of trait isn’t very ninja-like, is it? Anyway, don’t you always have a shuriken on you?

My rubber shuriken? Of course, I have tons of them~
This time, I ordered a replica of a shuriken said to have been used by Hattori Hanzo.

What? That sounds a little shady… Are you okay, Sengoku? You’re not being swindled, are you?

Ahaha, I’m alright. If it said it were real, even I’d know it was a scam.
I’ll love anything that has to do with ninjas, replica or not~♪

with Midori

    Location: In Front of the Lecture Hall


Midori-kuu~n! I found what you were looking for! Just to be sure, could you check that it’s the right one?

Yeah… I’m sure this is the one… Thanks for helping me out, Sengoku-kun…

No need to thank me, it was a help to me that you gave me this mission.
There was nothing to do for RYUSEITAI today, so frankly my schedule was pretty open…
Finding things is my specialty. If you ever need my help again, call out for me without hesitation~♪
But, what kind of basketball practice were you having that sent the basketball flying all the way to a place like this?

That’s what I’d like to know... I was told that we’d have practice at the basketball court today, so I came over knowing it was gonna be a pain…
Then Morisawa-senpai said that he launched the basketball or something…? This isn’t soccer, for crying out loud…

Ahaha… At any rate, I’m glad we found it.
… Hm? Isara-dono’s messaging me? Heheh, it seems I’ve been given another mission to carry out!
Excuse me, but I have to take my leave now! See you tomorrow, Midori-kun!

with Nazuna

    Location: Tennis Courts


There~...♪ Like~ that...♪
Oh, Nito-dono? By any chance, is the tennis club in the middle of practice?

Ghh?! Shinobun, don’t come into the tennis court outta nowhere. I almost hit you with the ball by mistake.

M-My apologies! When I saw Nito-dono, I just couldn’t help but barge in!
I seem to be in your way, so I’ll make my exit.

Nah, I’m just practicing on my own, so you’re not bothering me. Anyway, what were you up to, Shinobun?

I was looking around for a good ninja spot. If you find a place like that, please let me know~♪

Ahaha, a “ninja spot”? Mm, got it. I’ll contact you when I do, Shinobun.

Thank you~! I don’t know if you would consider this repayment, but… If you ever need a ninja, please seek me out~♪
Mnn…~ Is it fine if I don’t need a ninja? I feel lonely practicing alone, so if it’s okay, I&#39;d like you to keep me company.

Of course, as long as it&#39;s okay that it’s me! The Ninja Association conducts solitary activities too, so I don’t have much to do at the moment.
Ehehe, it looks like we&#39;ll have fun doing club activities today~♪

with Yuuta

    Location: 1-B Classroom


Let’s see, we’ve got class duty together today, right? Thanks for having me, Sengoku-kun~♪

A-And to you as well

Ahaha, we’re classmates, so you don’t have to be so nervous~

Fweh? Err, umm…~?

Well, I’m gonna write in the daily log, so could you erase the blackboard?

Y-Yessir! I&#39;ll make it quick~!
(Uuu~…  I’m making Aoi-kun worry about me. I’m sorry for being so shy.)
(At any rate, I must get the job done properly! I&#39;ll clean the blackboard and make it as good as new!)
Take that! And thaaaaaat… ouch?!

A-Are you okay? You’re not hurt, are you?

Don’t worry! I just slipped and fell! I’d rather you focus on the daily log, Aoi-kun!

You say that, but hearing someone go “Take that!” is gonna concern me whether you mean to or not.
Mm, I know a way to erase the board without having to jump around. If you’d like, I can show you how?

Eh? But wouldn’t it be a bother…?

We&#39;re on the same class duty shift, so we’ll finish up faster if we help each other out. You’re not gonna be a bother at all

Aoi-kun… W-Well then, please do. Ehehe, I&#39;m glad that Aoi-kun’s on duty with me today~♪

with Souma

    Location: Garden Space


Take that…☆

Hm…? Is that you there, Sengoku? Are you playing around with a bug net?

Oh, Kanzaki-dono! I wouldn’t call it playing around! I’m in the midst of catching frog food!

I see, come to think of it, you look after frogs, don’t you?

Indeed I do! I&#39;m glad that you remember what I said before~♪1
Momocchi and Thunder require lots of food every day, so today’s yet another day I&#39;m busy catching insects.

Is that so? If that’s the case, I’ll help you.

Eh, are you sure? You’d be seriously saving me~!
After all, you can hone in on moving objects so well that you can even catch flies with chopsticks!
I bet you can catch tons of insects, even with the butterfly net, Kanzaki-dono~!

Heheh, you have such sparkling eyes. That expectation for me makes me happy, and it urges me to respond in full.
Mm… Sengoku, stay still… Take that!

Oh! There are bugs in the net!
No way, that’s amazing! I didn&#39;t even realize there was a bug on my head!
As expected of Kanzaki-dono, you’re seriously the coolest ever…☆

I feel quite bashful being praised so earnestly like that. Sengoku, do you still need more insects?

Yes, I want to catch lots and lots! If you have the time, I’d like your assistance just a little longer, Kanzaki-dono~!

I don’t have any particular matter to attend to after this, so I’ll keep you company until you’re satisfied.

Wow, I'm so grateful~! Momocchi and Thunder will get to eat to their heart’s content, kyahoo~☆

Prologue

    Season: Winter


    Location: Garden Terrace


Whew… To have a good cup of tea while looking at beautiful flowers in full bloom... It truly is the highest luxury.
It&#39;s so rare to have such sunny, good weather on a winter day like this. I feel like I&#39;m in good shape.
Hehe, I can&#39;t help but want to sing……
(Cough, cough)

Eichi.... Why not enjoy the tea in moderation and go inside?
Yumenosaki Academy is built on a hill facing the ocean. Being exposed to the sea breeze must be harsh on your body.
Can you stand? If you can&#39;t, I&#39;ll give you a ride on my shoulders! Come now, please don&#39;t hesitate~☆

I wish you’d stop treating me like a child. I mean, I&#39;m the same height as you. If you carry me on your shoulders, won&#39;t you collapse?

 That might be so. If this were Himegimi, I could easily cuddle him in my arms, but carrying Eichi would likely be too difficult!
Well, clowns make the impossible possible. There&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t do...☆

I think “clowns” are meant to entertain people. Although in your case, Wataru, I think you’re more of a &quot;magician&quot; than a clown.

My selling point is my versatility! Please refer to me as both &quot;clown&quot; and &quot;magician”...♪

Good grief, I never get bored when I talk to you, Wataru. It’s like having the fun of an amusement park in the palm of your hand~♪

 Oh? Have you ever been to an amusement park, Eichi? Fufufu, they’re like a wonderland...☆
No matter how old they are, adults can forget time and have fun like the children they used to be. That is what makes them a wonderland.

Oh? I think you and amusement parks are a perfect match, actually. Isn&#39;t it easy to entertain children with your jack-of-all-trades talent?

 Fufufu. You say delightful things, don’t you...☆
Sometimes strict, sometimes sweet. I can only sing my praises of your ability to juggle the carrot and stick so adeptly!
Perhaps that’s why I can&#39;t leave His Majesty the Emperor’s side.
Could it be that you even had the skills of a beast-tamer on hand in order to keep me in one place, Eichi?

 Were you a beast? A clown, a magician, and a beast on top of that. I’m impressed.
… (Cough, cough)

 Oops, forgive me. I had so much fun chatting with you that your health slipped my mind.
Come, Eichi. Please put an end to your happy dream and come back to reality...☆

 I’d rather you don’t treat me like I’m sick, but… (cough, cough)... I really haven&#39;t been able to stop coughing for a while now.
I&#39;m going to go inside and warm up.
…………

What’s wrong, Eichi?

Mm, that person over there is Anzu-chan. She doesn’t seem to be feeling well. Maybe something happened?

Fufufu. Even though you’re the Emperor, you&#39;re still human. Or are you sweet on Anzu-san because she’s close to you?

 She did break down this school and rebuild it, after all. Well, I can&#39;t say it&#39;s a complete job, but she’s still coming along well.
Is it that strange that such a presence weighs on my mind?

 No. Anzu-san is also the person who made love bloom in the unfeeling, dull Hokuto-kun.
Even if it’s not to the extent as His Majesty the Emperor, Anzu-san intrigues me too…♪

 Anzu-chan’s also liked by an unexpected person now, hm? Is that another one of her talents?
In any case, we don&#39;t have the option of just leaving it be. Anzu-chan, would you like to come over here and have some tea with us?
…Hmm, I guess she didn&#39;t hear me. At this rate, she’ll just keep on her path.

In that case, I&#39;ll stop her in her tracks! Just watch! Un, deux, trois...☆

My, what a clever idea to put roses out on the path to stop her. It’s because you can produce that many roses in an instant that I can’t help but think you can even use magic~♪

It’s the highest honor to receive such praise! Come, Anzu-san. Can you see me? You do now, good!
Would you like some nice, warm tea? It&#39;s a hot drink that will fill you up and stave away the cold. … You bought tea from a vending machine?
But the weather is so cold, it sinks into your bones. There&#39;d be nothing worse to have than cold tea.
We have hot tea and scones laid out here~♪
Oh? The scones got a reaction out of you. Anzu-san, do you like clotted cream?
If so, let&#39;s add cream! Do you like jam? Then let’s add some jam, too!
Fufufu. It&#39;ll be a little tea party in no time! Come now, eat up~☆

 Oh dear, my job was taken away from me. Well, the tea that Wataru brews is quite delicious, so it&#39;s okay.
Whew... It&#39;s so tasty it envelops all your senses. I’d like him to join the “Tea Club” with talent like that.

 Though I’m known to be versatile, I can&#39;t split myself to be in many places at once. Although, I suppose it&#39;s not impossible if you master it.
If it came down to it, I’d just have to set up a body double...☆

 I can never tell how serious you are. Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Anzu-chan.
Even though I forced you to stop, it’s just me and Wataru speaking. That must be dull.
It looked like you were troubled about something, so I stopped you to speak with you.
Heheh, are you holding back, by any chance? I heard that you asked Kiryu-kun from AKATSUKI to give you pointers on how to make costumes.
I’m not saying to treat me like I’m Kiryu-kun, but I&#39;d be happy if you could open your heart to me a little, as well.
Thank you, Anzu-chan. Well then, could you tell me right away...?

Opera Chapter 1

    Season: Winter


    Location: Garden Terrace


Hmm. Keito approved of your skills at Quarrel Festival1, and entrusted you with the planning and management of an upcoming S2 event.
Even so, that Keito…
Heheh, why are you shrinking away? Are you feeling self-conscious about Keito since he was so hard on you during Quarrel Festival?
Am I wrong? If so, you should take it in stride. It means Keito recognizes your talent as a producer.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t give you another project, even if it was an S2.

As expected of my fated rival…☆ The fact that he has his eyes on you speaks to his discerning eye!
Quarrel Festival was so exciting, I couldn&#39;t believe it was B1.
If you’re the one producing the event this time too, students from all over school will come to see it...☆

If it were an S1, we could invite guests from outside the school. However, S2s – held once a month – can’t be expected to be as large as S1s.
Still, since it&#39;s an official Dream Festival, it will be reflected in your grades, and it will also affect your activity funds.
Oops, I didn&#39;t mean to put pressure on you, Anzu-chan. I suppose I was being careless with my words.
At any rate, it&#39;s not bad to have Keito rely on you. It&#39;s actually a good trend.
You&#39;ve been planning and managing S1s up to now, so I think you&#39;ll do well this time, too.
Don’t worry, you have talent. I’d like you to believe in yourself.

Fufufu, what a heartwarming sight...☆ But it’s time for me to ignore the atmosphere and cut in!
Even if I’m left alone, I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to wiggle my way back in...☆

It’s just like you to go out of your way to state your intentions, Wataru. In any case, I have something to discuss with you.

Oh? About what? If His Majesty the Emperor asks for it, I would even go to the other side of the world~☆

It&#39;s not as big of a request as that. It’s about Anzu-chan. It seems she still has such a long face.
I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s something else that&#39;s troubling her.

If so, you simply need to ask her directly! Anzu-san, are you perhaps… troubled with something?
Oh, you&#39;re restless. It seems it’s something to do with what&#39;s in your bag.
Perhaps there’s materials concerning AKATSUKI in it? Fufufu, your eyes keep darting around.
Anzu-san’s trouble is that she was asked to produce AKATSUKI, but…
You’re thinking, “I don’t know what kind of performance I should do!” — is that what it is?
Oops, are you alright? I didn’t expect you to be surprised enough to nearly fall out of your chair...☆

What’s with these leading questions? I’m impressed you were able to figure out her troubles through those hints alone.

If you have love, you can understand most things...☆
Nevertheless, a performance, is it? If you&#39;re looking for a program that’s typical of AKATSUKI, how about an opera? Maybe taking place around the latter half of the Meiji Era?2

Hehehe. She&#39;s clapping her hands with joy. Hm? If possible, you’d like to receive some acting guidance, too?
It&#39;s none other than Anzu-chan&#39;s request. Of course, I’ll listen...
(Cough, cough)

Don&#39;t push yourself too hard, Eichi. Although drinking tea warmed us up, it’s still this cold.
We had so much fun chatting that we ended up prolonging this peculiar tea party, but it&#39;s about time we wake up from our dream.
Neither Eichi nor I can be acting instructors, but let&#39;s support Anzu-san as much as we can...☆
For example, maybe we could do something like… participate in the program Anzu-san comes up with?
Fufufu, the role you want us to play has already been decided, hm? Truly splendid!

The role of a houseboy?3 Mm. If that&#39;s the plan, even if I&#39;m not in good shape, I&#39;ll be able to perform until the end…~♪

Am I the role of a Tsujigiri?4 It’s typically hard for me to get an opportunity to play the role of a villain like this.
More than anything, it seems fun, so of course I&#39;ll accept...☆

Keito and I fought with all that we had at Quarrel Festival, but this time it&#39;ll be different. I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing what kind of drama it will be...♪


    Location: Dojo


Ossu!5 Nagumo Tetora, coming in!

…………

Taishou!6 Nagumo Tetora, I’ve come in!!

…………

Uwaaa, please don’t ignore me! It’s Nagumo Tetora, Taishou~?!

Huh…? Ahh, Tetsu. Stop your stompin’ and c’mere. I need to check this costume size.


Ossu! I’ll do whatever you ask, Taichou! Er, like this?

… There’s a little extra sleeve here. Tetsu, have you gotten shorter?

Ehh, are you serious!? But, when I took my measurements the other day, my height didn’t change…?

Tch. This is Kanzaki&#39;s costume. I mixed it up by accident since the colors were similar. This is your costume.

Oooh, it&#39;s Taishou’s new work! The costumes are super cool too!!

Thanks, Tetsu. Hearin’ that makes me wanna make more. Well, all’s left to do is finish this thing…—

U-... Ummm~ Taishou?

What? I&#39;m tryin’ to figure this out, so couldja leave it for later?

No, but it’ll be a problem if you drown in your passion for sewing forever! This is a dojo, a place to practice, Taishou~?

It&#39;s so noisy in the classroom that I can&#39;t really concentrate on sewing. Here, it&#39;s quiet.
You should mind your manners at the dojo, too. You’re restless when I take my eyes off you, so it&#39;s a pain to put together your costume.

But I don&#39;t think you should sew at the dojo in the first place!? Taishou~, you’re the captain of the karate club, not the handicraft club.
It&#39;s great that you like sewing, but when you’re in the dojo, I’d like you to do karate instead!

Tetsu... That&#39;s right. You&#39;re right.

Taishou…!

I can hang out with you as soon as I put the finishing touches on this costume, so just wait a little longer.

A-... Alright~? It&#39;s true that it sucks to leave things unfinished. Ossu, Nagumo Tetora: I&#39;ll wait as long as you need!
...Oh, Anzu-anego? Hee~eey! Are you here to watch us practice?
Ah, you’ve got business with Taishou, huh? But right now he can&#39;t take his hands off sewing, so please wait ‘til he’s done~

Opera Chapter 2

    Location: Dojo


Oh yeah, do you have something to talk about with Taishou, Anzu-anego?
Hmhm. The leader of AKATSUKI asked you to plan and manage an S2, huh? As expected of Anego!
The fact that Hasumi-senpai gives you the time of day, it’s so respectable~♪
So, what kinda performance is it gonna be? Er, is it a bad idea for a RYUSEITAI member to ask this...?
You decided on the theme of the program after asking your seniors at fine, so you don&#39;t mind...? I’m happy to hear it!
Hmhm. An opera taking place around the latter half of the Meiji era. That&#39;s such a typical act for AKATSUKI, I’m pumped~♪
Huh, why do you look troubled? Did I say something weird...?
It was good that you decided on a performance, but then you realized there weren&#39;t enough people and panicked. Anzu-anego’s so scatterbrained~
Ah, I didn&#39;t mean to make fun of you. Taishou’s been absentminded like that too, so I felt a sense of familiarity!

… Did you call for me, Tetsu?

Ah, Taishou. You finished sewing. Thanks for your hard work~♪

Sorry for making you wait. Well then, let&#39;s practice—... Lil’ Miss?

Seems like she had something for you to do, Taishou. Since you were concentrating on sewing, I told Anego to wait ‘til you finished.

Looks like I’ve caused trouble to both Tetsu and lil’ miss. So, Miss. What am I takin’ care of for you?
Ah. You decided on the program for the S2 Hasumi asked you for, so you came to let me know. Then, have you told Hasumi yet?
Is that right? I guess you thought you’d tell me and then let him know, but maybe you’re telling the wrong person first...?
Hmm. Since I’ve been helpin’ you out with costume-making and physical training, my face was the first thing that popped into your head?
Haha. You’re really good at flattery, huh. Good grief, I’m no match for her at all...♪


Oh, Taishou is smiling like he would at his little sister! This is super valuable~! Click click~☆
Hey, Tetsu. Using smartphones in the dojo is prohibited. Do you want me to confiscate it?

O-Ossu! I&#39;ll be mindful next time! So please don’t take it from me~!!

You don’t need to apologize with a dogeza on top of that... C’mon, Tetsu. I&#39;m not angry anymore, so lift your head.

Uuu, Taishou is kind. I think I might fall in love with that kindness~♪

Errr… what were we talking about?

So fast! You forgot so fast, Taishou!?7

Uhhhh... Ah, I remembered. It was about the S2. An opera is a performance typical for AKATSUKI, and I think Hasumi would approve of it.
I was just trying to make military uniforms. Since AKATSUKI is a Japanese-style unit, I didn’t think we’d get to wear something that isn’t a kimono. Looks like we’ll get to use ‘em now.

…………

Why do you keep glancing around, Tetsu? Do you needta piss?

No! Taishou, have you no sense of delicacy!?

Haha, sorry. Yeah, Lil’ Miss is here, too. There&#39;s no way you can mention needing the toilet in front of the girl you admire.

Th-That&#39;s not what I meant! I mean, yeah, Anzu-anego is my aspiration…? But, but! That&#39;s not what I wanna say right now…?

It’s not manly to be so restless like that. If you got somethin’ to say, just say it.

O-Ossu!! (Breathe in, breathe out)...
Anzu-anego, I wanna be in the opera, too...!!
… You see, just before Anego transferred here… I wanted to join AKATSUKI, but I failed the exam. Even now, I get frustrated when I think back on that time.
But then, I was invited by Taichou to join RYUSEITAI... And at first, I was reluctant to participate properly, but...
I’m really grateful to be a member of RYUSEITAI now, from the very bottom of my heart. So, I’ve got no complaints there.
But somewhere in my heart is the longing to work with Taishou, again.
I still haven&#39;t become as manly as Taishou, but I&#39;d like to study him up close on stage.
That&#39;s why when I heard what Anego was saying, I figured this was my only chance. If I miss this, there might not be another one.
Please, Anego. Please let me be in the opera...!!

Can I ask you for that favor, too?

T-Taishou…?

Tetsu may be rough around the edges, but he has the qualities of an idol. More than anything, he and I are compatible.
It might be an irregular case, but if the members aren&#39;t decided yet, I&#39;d be glad if you could get Tetsu in the mix.
Ahh, thanks. But man, you accepted that favor so easily. I thought you&#39;d have more to say...?
You’re grateful for Tetsu&#39;s offer since you didn&#39;t have enough people to begin with?
His role… ... that&#39;s right. With Tetsu&#39;s personality, it’d be tough for him to play the role of Tsujigiri. Wouldn&#39;t a night watchman be more suitable for him?
The role of Tsujigiri is... Hibiki? I&#39;m sure he can deal with multiple people without issue, but it’d be good to have at least one more person if we can.
I&#39;ll try to find a few people, but could you give it some thought, too, lil’ Miss?

Pardon me...!!

Challenging the dojo is a feat of courage…–8 er, isn&#39;t that Morisawa? Don&#39;t enter in a misleading way.

Ha ha ha, sorry~☆ Anyway, is Nagumo here?

Taichou’s always causing trouble, isn&#39;t he?

Ohh, Nagumo, have you been well? Today, I&#39;m shining with the brilliance of the sun in the sky again, fwahahahaha...☆

Mnn, I don&#39;t want people to think we&#39;re acquaintances... So, Taichou. Please tell me what you want without laughing so loud.

Mm. Nagumo…– no, Ryusei Black! Do you know what day it is? That&#39;s right, it&#39;s the day for RYUSEITAI’s activities...☆

Huh? Isn&#39;t that tomorrow?

Oops, I should’ve realized that, huh? That was careless of me. But, it’s too late now, I’ve already come to pick you up!

Ehh~? I wanna do karate practice with Taishou. Plus, I wanna talk to Anego about the opera, too.

Anego...? Ohh, Anzu’s with you, huh? Well aren’t you a smooth guy, you~♪

Uuu. Taishou’s attitude didn’t annoy me before, but it’s kinda irritating when it’s Taichou...

Hmm, is this also a matter of difference in core nature?9 Well, alright. What was this about an opera? Could you fill me in on it, too?
Depending on the details, I might as well join in too, fwahahaha~☆

Opera Chapter 3

    Location: Dojo


Hmm. The more I hear about it, the more fun it seems! Alright! I&#39;ll join in too...☆

Eh!? Taichou’s gonna participate too!?
Well, Anzu-anego told us there was a shortage of people, so she’d probably be happy if Taichou participated...?

I see, I see… Anzu’s a good kid, huh~ There, there~♪ (Pat, pat)

Morisawa, lil&#39; Miss&#39;s eyes are spinnin’. She’s a girl, so be gentle with her.

Ooh, forgive me for this! Lately, my juniors growing so well has resonated with me so much that I can&#39;t help but feel overwhelmed with emotion.
But, all kinds of people like you, Anzu. If you became the leader of any unit, there would be nothing to fear...☆
Oops, there&#39;s no point just standing around chatting. This is going to take some time to prepare, right?
At any rate, I&#39;ll join in too! As a night watchman...☆

Taichou’s gonna be a night watchman too?

Mhm. Because I’m an “ally of justice”! Tsujigiri go against justice, so I don’t want to be one!

Isn’t that pretty selfish of you~? But true, if Taichou were casted as Tsujigiri, it just wouldn’t feel right. He might be good as a watchman.

Mn? Ahh, that&#39;s right. Could you tell Hasumi about all this before lunch break ends?
Kanzaki should also be in the student council room around now. Right, I’m counting on ya, Lil’ Miss~♪


    Location: Student Council Room


Kanzaki. Please put all of the outgoing documents in the box over there.

Understood, leave it to me...♪ However, you work all day long, even during lunch breaks. Is your physical health alright, Hasumi-dono...?

This is always how it is. Besides, Eichi&#39;s health tends to deteriorate around this time of year. I don&#39;t want to force him to do too much.

Hasumi-dono’s so thoughtful of his friends~♪
For me personally, I can’t say that I don’t have my own thoughts about Tenshouin Eichi. After Tormenting Hasumi-dono, and pushing AKATSUKI to the brink of disbandment…
However, that was a fight between Hasumi-dono and Tenshouin Eichi.
If by exchanging fists, you deepened your friendship, then there’s nothing more I can say about it~♪10

Thank you, Kanzaki. There, there~♪ (Pat, pat)

H-Hasumi-dono. I&#39;m happy to be patted on the head, but I&#39;d appreciate it if you’d be a little more gentle with me!
It’s probably because you’re gripping my head, but I’m feeling dizzy!

Ahh, sorry. Maybe since I’ve been holding my pen so long, I couldn&#39;t adjust my strength properly.

How much force did you use to hold the pen!?
Ah, ow. Hasumi-dono, please stop already–
Ah, Anzu-dono! Did you sense my predicament and come to save me?
No, I can&#39;t ask for help from someone who’s no different from my lord, that’s absurd...!
I&#39;ve been relying on Anzu-dono before, and I&#39;m relying on Anzu-dono again… I&#39;ll have no choice but to pay for this with my life! I will apologize through seppuku!11

Stop trying to solve everything with seppuku.

B-But…! I can&#39;t think of any other way to make amends…!

If you keep saying “seppuku, seppuku”, I&#39;ll confiscate that sword, alright?

I– I&#39;ll be a good boy! So my sword… just my sword...!! Uuuuuuaaa!

I get it already, so don&#39;t cry. Here, use this handkerchief to wipe your face.

Uuu… hgh…

Have you settled down?

Mm. I’m very sorry for losing my composure! Please rest assured that the “hankachi” I borrowed will be washed and returned.

You don&#39;t have to worry about it that much... More importantly, Anzu. What business do you have in the Student Council room? It&#39;s not like you came here for nothing, right?
Hmm. It’s about the S2?
… Certainly, if that&#39;s what you’re going with, it’ll be appropriate for AKATSUKI. That’s impressive thinking, Anzu… There, there~♪

Ooh, Hasumi-dono is patting Anzu-dono on the head with a gentle smile! Since you also patted me, you must be in a good mood today, are you not..?

I’m intrigued, however. An opera is an interesting thing to come up with.
… What? Hibiki gave you the idea?
………….

H-Hasumi-dono! Anzu-dono is in pain!

…… Forgive me. It seems that I lost my cool when I heard Hibiki&#39;s name. I see, so this is Hibiki’s...

You have a far-off look in your eyes, was it that shocking to hear...?
This is bad. I have to bring Hasumi-dono back to reality, somehow…!!

Eichi...? Anzu, you… did you say Eichi? Does that mean that Eichi is also involved in this matter?
I see, Eichi will also be participating as a houseboy. If that’s his role, there won&#39;t be that many scenes. Eichi will probably have enough physical strength to make it to the end.
Hibiki… is playing the role of a Tsujigiri? I hate to say this as if I’m acknowledging him, but if it’s him, he could play any role.

As soon as Hasumi-dono heard Tenshouin-dono’s name, his eyes lit up. The power of friends truly is mighty...♪

A first-year and a third-year from RYUSEITAI will also be participating as night watchmen? … I don&#39;t mean to complain, but that’s a lot of watchmen, isn’t it?
I’m sure Hibiki could do the job on his own, but I&#39;d like to see at least one other person in the role of Tsujigiri.
Kiryu said the same thing as me? Hmm. So we had the same thought, huh. Let me think of someone from my side...
What? Kiryu said that too? I don&#39;t mean to think that much like him…
But we both belong to the same unit. Maybe we’ve grown to have similar trains of thought.
Anyway, I&#39;ll think about this as well, but “Opera” is a DreamFes that you’re to plan and run. In the end, your decision is what takes precedence.
I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what kind of person you choose, “Producer”.

Opera Chapter 4

    Location: Practice Room


Wahahahahaha, wahahahahaha, wahahahaha…☆
Ooh, you must be surprised ‘cause I suddenly barged in! I love you, I love you even more! ☆
Well, I overheard something interesting. You&#39;re gonna do an Opera S2, right?
Who are the characters? Demons? Fairies? Or maybe heroes?
OK, Tsujigiri, houseboy, and night watchmen. The setting is the latter half of the Meiji era...AaaaAH!
It’s expanding, a wild fantasy’s enveloping the universe... ☆ It&#39;s descending, it&#39;s descending, inspiration is coming! ☆
♪～♪～
Hey, don&#39;t talk to me! I&#39;m playing an opera right now, grrrrrrrr!
Japanese opera is a performing art consisting of theater and music, just like “Opera”, y’know?
So there’s no way I’d be the only one casted out!! After all, I&#39;m Tsuki… Tsuki...?
Crap—?! Was I so obsessed with writing my masterpiece that I lost even my sense of self?
Where are we!? Who am I? AaaaAAAH!! I can&#39;t remember anything...!!
… Tsukinaga Leo? That&#39;s right, that&#39;s the name! That was close, I almost lost my identity there...☆
Thank you, Anzu. I knew it&#39;d be right to ask you!!
I guess I was right when I said, “If you have any trouble, ask Anzu“...☆
Ah, yeah, this is my notebook. Look, it says here, “If you have any trouble, ask Anzu”.
Before this, I wrote it like, “Because she’s everywhere”, but even when I called or yelled your name, you wouldn’t show up~?
You’re such a liar, Anzu! If I&#39;m ever kidnapped and reengineered by aliens, I&#39;ll brainwash you first!
And then I’ll make it so you can only say “Ucchu~” and suffer, wahahahahaha...☆
Oh wait no, nonono!
You&#39;re a producer, right? What&#39;s more, you’re a talented producer that everyone relies on...☆
So if Anzu can only say “Ucchu~”, then no one would be able to communicate with her...!!
No, to be precise, it’d have probably been “Daiuchuu~☆”12, not “Ucchu~”, but…

The point is, it’d be trouble if you started talking in a voice so peculiar!
That would be the same universal loss as the disappearance of the infinitely-expanding seedling that is music...!
Okay, I&#39;ve decided! Even if I am reengineered, I won’t brainwash you! So, please stay as you are...☆
~……♪
It’s done, it’s done, a world-class masterpiece…! Dance and sing by my hand, and enjoy yourself~ Wahahahaha!
So that’s how I’ve thought up this masterpiece, but could you give me your thoughts on it?
There’s more acting than singing in it? Your intuition’s so good. I love you☆
The historical background and content are very AKATSUKI-esque, but don’t you think that’s boring?
Also, since it’s not just the members of AKATSUKI who’re participating, I think it’d be more fun to make it an action drama.
Mhm, mhm, I really am a genius...☆
Eh? How did I know?
There are countless operas hidden in the academy...! By pick them up, connecting them, and then tying them all together, the answer will come out!
You want me to tell you the truth? Don&#39;t talk about boring reality! Let me fantasize!
But I don&#39;t really mean to bother you, so I&#39;ll make an exception and tell you...☆
Let me see… When I was passing by the garden space, I saw you and the Emperor talking.
I listened carefully to see what it was you were talking about, and it turned out to be… an opera? “What? That seems interesting” ...☆
That&#39;s why I wanted to participate, too, so I made a lot of plans. So far, this is the first one!
The second one? You&#39;re looking for someone to play the role of Tsujigiri, right?
Here's the second candidate for the role~☆ I'm not good at singing, but I am good at leaping and jumping~

I dunno everyone in AKATSUKI, so I&#39;m the right person for the job, right?
Ohhh, she’s pondering, she’s pondering! The pose of a person thinking with her hand on her chin? You&#39;re so easy to figure out; I really do love you~☆
Hmhmhmm~♪
Now we have all the characters! The opera, the action drama begins...☆ I can&#39;t stop, because my imagination is the whole universe!
There&#39;s a saying, right? Being in the right place at the right time? Leave the script to me and concentrate on making the costumes!
Now, what kinda story should we weave? I&#39;m looking forward to it, wahahahaha...☆

I thought it was noisy. It’s you, huh, Tsukinaga?

Ah, it&#39;s Kuro, it&#39;s been a while!

It&#39;s not like it&#39;s been that long. We&#39;re in the same class, and we had class together today, too.

Huh? Is that so? Hnn? Nmmmm…?
I remembered! Come to think of it, it&#39;s been quite a while since I was readmitted to the school. Mnn, why did I come back? Uuu, I can&#39;t remember!

This is too early of an age to be so senile. Also, don&#39;t pound your hands on someone&#39;s body.

Ah— sorry! Kuro’s so big that it makes me wanna bash on him~♪

What kinda logic is that? Seriously, you’re hyper whether it&#39;s morning or the end of the day.


It’s ‘cause I&#39;m always communicating with the universe! C’mon Kuro, do the greeting too! Ucchu~!

The industry standard is “Good morning”. The hell’s “Ucchu~”? Are you an alien?

I&#39;ve met them before, but I&#39;m not an alien!

Well then, “Ucchu~” is wrong. You’ll get in all sorts of trouble if you can&#39;t greet someone properly.

You may look scary, Kuro, but you’re more like a mother. Should I call you Mom from now on?
But I don&#39;t want a mom this big! Never mind, Kuro is just Kuro after all. Here boy, Kuro~♪

I&#39;m not a dog or cat, y’know.

I know. Kuro is Kuro... ☆ So, why’re you here? Did you receive radio waves or something?

Don’t mix me up with you. You should have a guess given I’m wearin’ my practice clothes, but…
There’s not much time left until the S2.
I gotta give out a performance that makes lil’ Miss glad she produced us…♪

Opera Chapter 5

    Location: Practice Room


So admirable, Kuro. I&#39;ll praise you~ There, there~♪

You don&#39;t need to tip-toe and stretch just to pat me. More importantly, why’re you here, Tsukinaga? Did you have business with Anzu?

Well, when I heard that Anzu was going to do an opera, I thought it was interesting, so I decided to take part too...☆

So, does that mean you’ll play the role of Tsujigiri...? Compared to Hibiki, you pack a little less of a punch.
Then again, you have crazy good physical ability, so I&#39;m sure you’ll be just as good on stage as him...♪
Now all we have to do is create the script and costumes... huh? Tsukinaga’s thinking up the script?
He forced himself into your plans? Lil’ Miss also met with disaster, huh? That’s just how Tsukinaga is; a wild guy, don’tcha think?
The fact that he doesn&#39;t listen to what others hafta say hasn&#39;t changed from the beginning. I can&#39;t help but wonder why Tsukinaga wasn&#39;t counted as one of the “Five Eccentrics”.
But... Tsukinaga? If Hasumi finds out about this, he&#39;ll probably pass out...?

Who’s Hasumi? Is he an alien!?

Stop trying to connect everything to space. And you gotta stop forgetting everything, man.

I&#39;ve been busy since the end of the year, and then there was also winter break…?
When you keep staying at home and then going out over and over, you&#39;ll forget a lot of things~♪
Hasumi...Hasumi...Hasumin... I got it now, he’s a friend of fairies~☆13
So does this mean that Kuro is a resident of fairy-tale, and you’re even friends with fairies? Wow, you’re part of a fairy-tale even though you’re so humongous!

… You seriously don&#39;t remember? Or have you finally gone crazy?
Hasumi is in the same archery club as you, and he&#39;s the head of it, too.

Ahhh nooo, don&#39;t give me a simple answer like that! You’re just like Keito, so boring with conversations!

The hell, you do remember him, then. If you&#39;re this forgetful, won’t it be hard for you to remember your lines...?

What someone should remember and what they don&#39;t care about are two different things, right? I&#39;m not such an incompetent king that I forget everything!
Well, whatever. The point is, that&#39;s why I&#39;m participating too! Look forward to the kinda opera I’ll perform, wahahahahaha...☆


    Location: Student Council Room


… Phew, just one more seal on this document, and I can give it a rest.
I thought I wouldn&#39;t make it when I had to work on such short notice, but finishing this up will allow me to participate in practice without any problems.
Mm? Kanzaki, is that you? I don’t have any particular task for you today–

Just here t’visit.

Anzu and Kiryu…? You&#39;re wearing your practice clothes, wh-... Ah, you came to get me because I hadn&#39;t shown up?
Sorry to keep you waiting. But this is good timing, as I&#39;ve just finished my work. I&#39;ve already gotten changed, so that won&#39;t take up any time.

Sorry to interrupt your enthusiasm, but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re here to talk about.
You also asked lil&#39; miss to find another Tsujigiri for you, right?

So, you did?

He was found alright. Or more like, it was forced entry....... Hasumi, don&#39;t freak out, just listen to me.
The Tsujigiri role’s gonna be filled in by Tsukinaga.


…………

Oi, Hasumi-no-danna~?14 Pull it together. I know it&#39;s jarrin&#39;, but it&#39;s forreal.
Should I say it a bunch’a times &#39;til you can face the reality of it?

N-... No, it’s… fine… I was just a little dizzy from all the different ... colorful personalities. Hibiki and Tsukinaga...
I won’t lecture this matter to Anzu, too much. He’s the personification of a whirlwind. Our common sense won&#39;t apply at all to him.
Tsukinaga probably pushed her into it. If anything, I sympathize with her.

So you don&#39;t have a problem with Tsukinaga participatin&#39;?

There are plenty of problems, but I guess it can&#39;t be helped. There’s not many people out there that can keep up with Hibiki of the &quot;Three Eccentrics&quot;.
Anyway, I&#39;ll keep an eye on it to make sure nothing goes awry. ...... Maybe I should ask Isara to order some extra stomach medicine for me.


    Location: Opera Stage


(U, Uuu~ It’s finally the day of Opera!)
(I’m happy to be on the same stage as Taishou again, but my legs won’t stop wobbling from the nerves…~)
(Whenever I’m with everyone in RYUSEITAI, my mind feels pretty focused, but right now it’s totally blank. I can barely think, like I’ve been thrown on stage completely naked.)
(Maybe I’m just terrified after hearin’ about the other members of [Opera] from Anzu-anego......)
(I’m the only first-year, and the rest are second-years and third-years. And what’s more, there’s two of Yumenosaki’s strongest units’ leaders here. Ah– and if you count Taichou, that’s three.)
(Ugh! I’m clearly the only one who sticks out here! If I screw it up, it’ll be completely obvious!?)

…… Kiryu doesn’t seem to be concerned, and you’ve had plenty of practice, haven’t you?

O-Ossu! I practiced a lot until Taishou said it looked good, so I’ll be fine I think! I look forward to working with you today!!

Ah, I’ll leave it to you, then.

(Uwaaa, I’m so nervous that I can barely think of any topics to talk about~! The silence is painful!)
(I practiced tons with Taishou and Taichou, but I didn’t practice enough with Hasumi-senpai. Honestly, I’m worried if I’ll be able to do well…)
(Plus, I was too distracted by the other seniors at the joint rehearsal ’cause they were so lively. And I&#39;m extra worried about the &quot;Opera,&quot; since it isn&#39;t the typical song-and-dance performance!)
(No—! Don’t get scared! Men need to have guts! Ossu, Nagumo Tetora. Let&#39;s do this~!!)
H-Hashumi-shenpai!
(UaaaAAAA! I fumbled it, completely, magnificently fumbled it! Hasumi-senpai’s lookin’ at me like, “What the hell is with this guy?” I can’t handle bein’ here any longer~!)

Don’t look so anxious, the real show is about to begin. You were chosen as a member of “Opera”, so make sure to be dignified.

Y… You’re not angry?

There&#39;s no reason to be angry. I had a hard time during my first year too. I can understand your nervousness.
You&#39;re still a first-year. There’s no one in this world who’s perfect from the beginning. The real deal is those who work hard to get what they want.
“Opera” will be a good experience for you. Don&#39;t be afraid of “What if I fail, though…”
Failure is also a valuable experience. Although of course, it&#39;s better not to fail.

… Hasumi-senpai.

I think we’ve talked a little too much. The curtains are about to rise. Get ready too.


(Ever since I failed the AKATSUKI exam, It felt kinda like a struggle to be around Hasumi-senpai.)
(But I feel like I understand why Taishou wanted to follow Hasumi-senpai just a lil’ bit more, now...♪)

Opera Chapter 6

    Location: Opera Stage


&quot;Come, come, observe! An incredibly hilarious, ridiculous tragicomedy is starting～♪”
“The script? Written by me~ I&#39;m an amazing genius loved by God, so a screenplay is child’s play~☆”
&quot;Now then! The curtain’s about to rise~ so take your seats and welcome us with thunderous applause! Wahahahahaha......☆&quot;

Oi, Tsukinaga. Y’know I’m about to catch you and throw you in jail soon, right? So why’re you acting so weirdly giddy?

Ooh, Kuro. Your eyes are so serious! You could kill a man with that gaze……☆
But sorry! I’m not that easy to catch…! Where’s the fun in that~?
You also know I won’t make it easy for you, don’t you?
I’ll fight with all my might, so you should come at me good, Kuro~
I may have taken a lot of time off idol work, but I figured now would be good to fight on the frontlines from here on.
Let’s show our gallant figures to the rookies. Let’s make ‘em think, “being an idol really is fun”.
If we can make ‘em wanna take after us, wouldn’t that be the most fun ever?

…… You’re right. It’s just as you say.
I’ve got a cute junior performing in Opera, too. I can’t show him anything uncool, huh?


Good, good, that bloodlust! Wouldn’t you be more suited for a Tsujigiri than a watchman~?
Well then, I’ll have to get serious, too. I can’t take the Emperor’s head until I defeat Kuro.……☆

Fufu, how dreadful. I’m just a houseboy right now. If a Tsujigiri came for my life, I wouldn’t stand a chance.

You say that, but aren’t you a little too calm and composed about it?
If you don’t give us more of a sense of urgency that you’re gettin’ snatched by Tsukinaga, the audience isn’t gonna feel it either.

But I certainly meant to act in accordance with Tsukinaga-kun&#39;s script.

Ah, gotcha, gotcha. In other words, you may be dressed up like some modest houseboy, but you’re still undeniably the Emperor.


Whoops. If I keep saying things that aren’t in the script, the audience’ll get confused. Let’s just talk swords from here on out……♪
“Prepare yourself, Tsujigiri.”

(Ohh… Taishou, you’re so powerful! If I was a Tsujigiri, I’d give up before the fight even started!)
(It’s amazing the other guy doesn’t even balk when he sees bloodlust like that.)
(As expected of the powerhouse unit… the leader of Knights!)

Nagumo, don’t lose focus. Who’s our enemy? It’s Hibiki, not Tsukinaga, right?

O-Ossu! Sorry!! I’ll reflect on this!!

If you have the time to reflect, you have the time to act… Kh…!

Hasumi-senpai!?

“... Nagumo, concentrate. Right now, I’m the Taichou.”

“Oh? What’s wrong, my archnemesis? Aren’t you my fated rival? If that’s true, then you should be able to evade my blade…!!”
“You shouldn’t be babysitting while you try to fight me; I’m not that easy of an enemy to defeat, you know?”

“Hmph, that was just a tryout.”

“Fufufu, you’re bad at lying, aren’t you? Well, it’s fine. If that was just a tryout, then come at me with your full strength, please.”
“Or else, I’ll go for snapping your knees, do you understand…?”

(Incorrigible, Anzu let this horrific guy participate, too. That clown has only been ad-libbing, it’s entirely different from what we practiced…)
(No, I’ll stop complaining. I’m the leader of AKATSUKI. I won’t let the likes of Hibiki get away with this.)

“～……♪”

(But… It’ll be bad if this keeps going. Having to act while singing is different from a typical performance. It’s difficult moving from one place to another.)
(Not to mention, Nagumo seems to be the kind of person who acts on instinct, so he keeps moving without thinking.)
(While Hibiki is the type of person who’d toy with his opponent. Nagumo isn’t compatible with someone like him.)
(In that case, what about Kanzaki? … He and Nagumo both have that straightforward side to them. They’re trying to catch him off guard for an attack, but he’s parrying successfully.)
(Morisawa also has capabilities, but his hands seem to be full backing up Nagumo and Kanzaki.)
(As for Kiryu, he’s facing off against Tsukinaga on his own, so this is a four-man operation all to pin down Hibiki on his own…)


(Just as I thought, I’ve got no choice but to rework my strategy.)
Nagumo, on my sign, flank Hibiki from behind. Kanzaki, you too. Join Nagumo.
Morisawa, watch the scene, play it by ear, and move in when the time’s right.
(Up until now, we’ve been scattered in trying to take on Hibiki, so we managed to make an opening.)
(If it were just some random person, I’d have been able to defeat him just like that, but it’s Hibiki Wataru of the Three Eccentrics.)
(Given the circumstances, even with Morisawa, we can’t defeat Hibiki.)

&quot;You look like you&#39;re planning something! Splendid! Just what I’d expect from my lifetime rival......☆”

&quot;I feel like I’ve said this many times before, but I don’t remember ever becoming your rival.”

&quot;Fufufu, so humble! If you would, please don’t fail my expectations. Night watchmen......☆&quot;

(He really prattles on a lot. Nevertheless, I’ll make sure he regrets that behavior backfiring on him.)
(Nagumo, now…!)

“Nagumo Tetora, on the move! UUOOOOHHH…!!”

“Divine punishment…!”

“Oops, a surprise attack from behind is very clever. But—”

“HA-HA-HA, I’ve blocked your way out! Prepare yourself for the confines of justice……☆”

“You heard him. I won’t let you get away, Hibiki.”

“Well, it’s four against one. If you coordinate like that, there’s nothing I can do to escape.”
“Very well then. I’ll come quietly…♪”

Looks like it&#39;s all settled over there.
As long as those guys join forces, even someone like you won’t be able to handle it.
We’re wrapping up the swordplay. After the break, the main event is the live performance. Let&#39;s hurry up and get ready.

I see, I see. That’s too bad, I wanted to play a little longer~

I feel the same as Tsukinaga-kun. It’s so much fun that I can’t help but laugh.
(Cough, cough)

That&#39;s not laughter, that&#39;s a cough. Maybe your health got worse after Tsukinaga swung you around so much?

That might be it, huh? It was fun, like a roller coaster, but I think I reached my physical limit first.
Thanks for entertaining me, Tsukinaga-kun......♪

I didn&#39;t mean to entertain the Emperor, though. Oh well, it’s fine.
I had fun, too! The audience and Anzu were all happy! I could write a masterpiece based on that fact alone!
This is what makes life so interesting~☆ Even when the curtain falls, I’ll keep singing and dancing, because I’m the Naked King, wahahahaha~☆15
Epilogue

    Location: Opera Stage


Kuro, Keito, Anzu, thanks for your hard work~☆

Just what are you thanking us for? Even though the curtain went down, you made such a clamor that we had to take the stage for an encore.
And at the end of it, you invited Anzu to come and stand on stage too. It was unprecedented!

‘Cause Anzu’s one of us. It&#39;s not good to be left out, right~?

… You’re hopeless. You’re the same now as you were in the past.
Oh, yeah. I remember what I was going to tell you ...... Hey, why are you shrinking back?

It’s ‘cuz Keito’s sermons are long. And even Anzu looks traumatized from a lecture you gave her, yeah?

M-Mm. Is this about… Quarrel Festival?
But that initial proposal was really awful. It was so terrible it made me dizzy.

Hasumi, leave it at that. Lil Miss’s so shocked that she&#39;s dissociating.

S-Sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to harp on about something that’s done and gone.
At any rate, it&#39;s true that that one incident gave me an appreciation for Anzu. There are only a few people who can get back on their feet from one of my lectures.
I was nervous about what would happen with Tsukinaga participating in the opera, but the audience was very receptive to it.
I look forward to working with you from now on as well, &quot;Producer&quot;.

Oh, even Keito can make a gentle face, a new discovery. ......☆
While I was away, the &quot;Emperor&quot; was defeated, and a revolution happened. Yumenosaki Academy is too interesting...☆.
Aaaaaah, I think I can write a magnificent song now! I have to write down my inspiration before I forget!

Don&#39;t scribble magic pen on the floor and walls. You tried to doodle on the floors of the archery grounds before—
…………

Hmmm, is something on my face? Did I accidentally get magic marker on it?

Ohh, I remember, I remember very clearly. That damned memory…

That was a complete about-face from gentle to demonic!?16 You&#39;re so interesting, I love you ☆

I hate you.
Heh… Heheh, heheh… Thanks to all your scribbling on the floor and walls of the archery hall, I spent the whole night trying to erase it.
I was going to tell you to turn up to club activities, but I take it back. Tsukinaga Leo, you are to never step over the threshold of the archery hall again.

OK, got it~♪

Wh–...... you agreed just like that? Shouldn’t you be more worried or regretful or something!?

Mm~ Well, I&#39;m a ghost member17. I&#39;d rather teach Anzu how to write songs, anyways.
It won&#39;t be long before I graduate, so I have to get Anzu to full operation by then, yeah~?
Wouldn’t it be sad to see all that effort I put into teaching her go to waste?
I mean, it&#39;s a world-wide loss to have my valuable spare time squandered on something that&#39;s pointless!
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t have time to show up for club activities. Sorry, Keito.

Hmph. I&#39;m the one who kicked you out, so it’s not like you have to apologize.

Keito’s such a tsundere!
Ahh, I just casually used slang~!? So stupid of me! I’m a genius but an idiot, too!!
Well, it’s fine. That’s what I plan to do, so you&#39;d better work harder with what little time we have left, okay~?
Knights are invincible with the weapons I provide, but you should at least be able to offer a piece of advice to the others when they’re in a tight spot.
Don&#39;t forget that the line and staff are a key balance in war.
Now I know that they took great care of the Knights while I was gone.

Lil Miss’s a hardworking girl, y’know.
There’s no complaints to make about her costume-making skills, and I can&#39;t wait to see how good of a tailor she’ll be by the time I graduate.
Whoa, don&#39;t look so sad. I’m bad with gloomy moods…
Well, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re graduating anytime soon. There are still a lotta things I wanna teach Tetsu, anyway.

There’s a reason Kiryu praises him; Nagumo has a lot of room for growth. His impulsiveness is a weak point, but I think he’s a good and honest junior.

Yeah. He’s a junior that’s way too good for me...♪
But it’s only at times like these that Tetsu&#39;s not around, huh... If Tetsu heard that line, I think he’d have cried with joy.
‘Cause he looked real depressed when he failed Hasumi’s exam.

But as a result of that, Nagumo is where he is today. His place of belonging wasn’t with AKATSUKI, but with RYUSEITAI. That&#39;s how it is, isn&#39;t it?

How hopeless, Hasumi-no-danna really just isn&#39;t an honest, huh. “Tsundere”, was it? Maybe that’s not so wrong after all…♪

    Season: Summer


    Location: Starmony Dorm Commons


 (... I know that singing and dancing aren’t the only jobs an idol does, but I never thought I&#39;d have to perform an ikebana1 demonstration)
(As Rhythm Link’s representative, I have to make sure I present something that doesn’t bring shame to the agency.)

…… all done~♪

 Really? I haven’t even put together the main materials yet. Do you have experience in this, by any chance—-
…… Shinkai. What is that?

what do you mean? it’s [ikebana], of course. from the school of [shinkai]2……☆

 There’s no helping you. Don’t claim to be a school as you please. No matter how you look at it, all you did was stick a fish onto the needle bed.
We’re arranging flowers, not fish. This is beyond unacceptable. As STAR PRO’s representative, don’t you feel the least bit shameful?

mmph… the only people who get to decide whether my [arrangement] is [acceptable] are the [beholders]. not you, [temple guy].☆
is it [bad] if I don’t follow the [model]? if that’s the only way to get [recognized], that’s a little boring, isn’t it?
anyway, I’ve grown tired of [ikebana], so i’m done here. i’m going to go [soak] in the [pond]……♪

….. What an uninhibited guy. He does realize that this would make it a “coral arrangement”, not a “floral arrangement”, right?3
(But Shinkai has a point. It’d be hard to say that it’s my work if I just stick to the textbook.)
(However, you should only be creative and break the rules after you’ve learned them. If you take it on with your own style while you’re inexperienced, you’ll end up with a ridiculous work of art.)
(Before anything else, I’ve got to thoroughly drill the basics in my head.)



    One hour later

(…… Hmm. This should be good enough for now.)
(But it looks just like the picture in the textbook……)

Hello. Are you doing ikebana? What an unusual hobby~

Not quite. I’m going to be participating in a flower-arranging demonstration. This is just practice.

I see. And this is… a fish arrangement? Is this your work too, Keito-kun?

That would be Shinkai’s work. It stinks, as you’d expect from fish… It doesn’t look like he’ll be coming back either. I’ll have to go put this in the kitchen.
That&#39;s right. Aoba, if you don&#39;t mind, could you give me your thoughts on my work? I can&#39;t really judge it for myself.

My thoughts? Mmnnn~ I think it looks nice, but…

Don’t hold back. I want your honest opinion.

No, it&#39;s not that I’m holding back. I just don&#39;t know much about ikebana. I know a lot about flower meanings, though.
Could I try it too? I feel like I could evaluate your work properly if I try it myself.

Hmm. They do say that teaching is the best way to learn……

(Sniff sniff)…  I thought it smelled like flowers here. It was you guys, huh?.

Ah, good afternoon. How about you join us, Ogami-kun?

Ehhh…?



    Another hour later

— And now for the arrangement. Place the flowers so that they fill in the gaps between the ones you just inserted.

In the gaps, got it~

Gaaaaah! I jumped in ‘cuz it looked interesting, but it’s taking forever! What a pain~!
I mean, it&#39;s not rock ‘n roll to fit into the mold! I’m just gonna be me, like this, this ‘n — this!
How’s that, Hasumi-senpai! This looks way more like an UNDEAD flower stand now. Cool, dontcha think~♪

First it was Shinkai, now it’s you… You’re truly hopeless…… We’re making flower arrangements, not flower stands.

I&#39;m baaack. Hah~, I&#39;m tired……
Aoba-onii-chan, you’re holding something nice, huh. Gimme that rose~♪

Of course, here you are.

Thank you. (Nibble nibble)…

— Y-You ate it?!

I didn’t eat it. I just wanted to get energy from the rose~4
Are you all playing with flowers together? How peaceful...

It’s ikebana. Come to think of it, aren’t you also making an appearance on the show?

Making an appearance.... Ah, that variety show. I see, so that’s why you’re doing this.
I don’t think they expect us to be proficient at it, so do we really need to practice?
We were invited to do our part as idols, so making the screen lively is enough, right?
Kei-chan, your stamina has its bounds, right? If you give anything and everything your all, one of these days you’re going to collapse.

Hmm. It’s a reasonable point.
But in order to leave a good mark, I intend to put my entire heart and soul into the task. Rhythm Link is already packed with top veterans, after all.
I’ll perform well so they’ll ask me to return. This is just me laying the groundwork in order to break into semi-regular status.

Hmm…… Well, I guess I&#39;ll join you guys and have some fun with the flowers, too. You&#39;ll probably improve if you have a rival...
And as NEW DI’s representative, I can&#39;t just stand by and watch…...♪

Hmph, do whatever you like. You&#39;re probably more of a natural at this sort of thing than I am, but...
Hard work will not betray me. I’ll have the last laugh.


  
  
  
  
Translation Notes
↑ Ikebana (生け花, lit. giving life to flowers) is the art of Japanese flower arrangement. Read about its principles and relationship with Buddhism here↑ Schools pass on the art of ikebana to students. Each individual school follows a particular set of principles, philosophies, and arranging techniques, all which vary depending on the school. Matching the name format of (school)-ryu (流), Kanata calls it 深海流 (School of Shinkai).↑ Originally, he says 生け花、生け魚 (flower arrangement, fish arrangement), but since it rhymed (hana, sakana), I wanted to preserve his pun.↑ A good reference for this is this Ritsu card from Fleur de Lis]]></content>

Let’s give everyone here a performance they won’t forget. Come on, Shinkai, don’t space out, let’s go.

Interviews
 Where would you go on a first date?
 A manga museum. I&#39;d like to show you my favorite works, but if we can&#39;t read them all in one day, we can come back another time.

 How about window-shoppin’? We won&#39;t run outta things to talk about when we’re lookin’ at all the different shops and goods. We can find out each other’s taste in fashion and what sorta trends are hot, too.

 What about a “cat ka-fay”? Cats look so adorable, just seeing them is sure to make the two of us smile...~♪

 I’d like to go to a theme park! ‘Cuz there’s all sortsa things we could do there together, like going on a buncha rides, buying souvenirs, and so much more~♪

 I think it’d be fun anywhere, as long as I’m with the person I love, but… For me, it’d be even more fun if we’re at a place that has yuruchara.

 I would love an opportunity to lead the way around a ninja village! I want to show you all there is to know about my favorite thing! Be it by witnessing ninjutsu, having a first-hand experience with it, or anything else of the like~♪

 A date means going to the amusement park! There’s roller coasters, the ferris wheel, and most importantly, hero shows! The day would pass by in a flash! ☆

 on warm days, i would like to have fun at the [ocean]~ and in the colder seasons, we can visit the [aquarium]...♪
 What was the last message exchange you had with someone in your unit?
 I contacted Kiryu and Kanzaki about our work schedules, but neither of them responded. Well, that isn’t unusual, though.

 I wanted to hear what their plans were for our new song, so I hit ‘em up. After that, we ended up meetin&#39; up and talkin&#39; face-to-face.

 I hadn&#39;t realized I&#39;d sent an incomprehensible string of characters, so I contacted my seniors to apologize. Handling a &quot;sumaho&quot; is difficult…

 I messaged everyone ‘bout when we’ll have our next practice session together! Midori-kun’s the only one who hasn’t responded yet, so I’m just gonna go and ask him directly!

 My parents gave me lots of vegetables, so I asked everyone in my unit if they’d like some before I offered them to anyone else. I’ll carry some with me later.

 Tetora-kun sent me our schedule for the practice session, so I replied to that! I’m in charge of booking us a practice room~♪

 I got my hands on some ninja-themed sentai merchandise, so I couldn’t help but message Sengoku about it. It made me happy to get a text praising how cool it looks! ☆

 i messaged chiaki that i am at the [ocean]. he gets [worried] when i do not tell him [where] i am.
 Why are you so cool?
 It&#39;s because of the support and encouragement around me. My friends and allies are the reason I can stand on stage and strive for greater heights.

 I guess it&#39;s ‘cuz AKATSUKI is where I can be with Hasumi ‘n Kanzaki. When I see those two honest guys, it’s like my spine just straightens up on its own.

 There&#39;s something about that comment that makes me feel bashful. However, I&#39;m pleased if my daily training has led to that kind of impression.

 Maybe it’s ‘cuz everyone’s always supporting me? Also, if you think my constant hard work towards my goal is somethin’ “cool”, then I’m real happy ‘bout that!

 I don’t really know how to answer that… But I think that it’s thanks to my parents that I was born with this face, so I’ll express my gratitude to them later…

 I-I’m cool? It surprises me to hear that, but I’d certainly be glad if you consider ninjas to be something cool!

 It might be because I dream of becoming a hero. And not just any hero, but a “cool” one…☆

 it is because there are so many [cool] people around me~ so maybe i am also more likely to be seen as cool along with them…?
 What are your best subjects?
 You could say that liberal arts as a whole are my strongpoint. I believe I&#39;ve not only excelled in Japanese language and history, but also in civics.

 I&#39;m good at sewin’ and cookin’, so home economics is my forte. I usually suck at studying the classic way... especially math; it hurts my head.

 I enjoy classical literature and Japanese history. On the contrary, I am not as good at English and world history. While I improve on my current abilities, I want to overcome my weaknesses too.

 I’m confident with my practical classes, like P.E. and home economics~♪ I wanna get better at theory-based subjects too, but it’s pretty difficult for me…

 Math’s my best subject, or more like, it’s the only thing I can do…? I’m not at all good with other subjects, so I think I’m pretty compatible with it.

 I’ve got a bit of confidence when it comes to Japanese history! I studied a whole lot to make myself well-versed with the era of ninjas~♪

 My best subjects are the liberal arts, like Japanese literature and language! And my weakest subject is math. I would always study until late at night before a test for that class.

 [history] and [biology] might be my best subjects? well, i say [biology], but i actually mean [fish]...♪
 What’s the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?
 I try to set aside the time for meditation. Not only does it improve my ability to concentrate and relax, but it seems to have a positive effect on creativity too.

 A while ago, I fell asleep with the light on in my room. Guess that’s why the first thing I do when I get up is to check if they’re still on.

 I prepare breakfast. Now that I have a new kitchen knife, I look forward to cooking with it every day~♪

 I heard it was good for your health if you drink a glass of water in the morning, so I do that. After that, I go out for my morning training routine.

 I play a yuruchara game on my phone. That’s the best way to spend time whenever you wanna lie in bed for a little longer, yeah?

 I try to do exercises that help you grow taller. I hope it works out, even if I only grow a tiny bit more~

 I begin my day with a fresh start by doing radio exercises!1 I get to move every muscle in my body in an efficient manner, and it also feels really good to refresh my mind and body first thing in the morning!

 i have new [fishies] in my room’s [water tanks], so i [check] how they are doing when i [greet] them~♪
Oshi Calls
 Keito Hasumi

 “This is Hasumi Keito from AKATSUKI. To put it bluntly, I’m wondering if you’ll choose me as your “oshi”.”
“Er, I’m sorry if I caught you off guard. If I hope to be chosen, I should probably talk more about my charm in my own words. Well then…”
“As AKATSUKI’s leader, I build up experience as an idol day by day. I work hard to make sure AKATSUKI evolves until everyone knows who we are as a unit.”
“Also…… Well, it’d be a long story if I were to go on. I’ll strive to give it my all, and let my work speak for itself. Keep your eyes on me, and see for yourself if I’m worthy of being your “oshi”.”

 Kuro Kiryu

 “Yo, I’m Kiryu Kuro. I work as part of AKATSUKI.”
“I&#39;m not really used to sellin’ myself, but this is a great opportunity. I gotta make sure you get to know a li’l bit about me.”
“The thing I&#39;m good at is sewin’. I make costumes for AKATSUKI, but I also stitch up outfits for other people if they request it. So, well, guess you could say I&#39;m good with my hands.”
“I dunno if if I did a good job showin’ off my good points…… but if you choose to support me, I&#39;ll repay it in full. If it’s fine with you, come along with me.”

 Souma Kanzaki

 “Ohhh, it connected~♪ I presume that you must be the “aidoru fan”. I am Kanzaki Souma, It’s a pleasure to meet you!”
“I am an “aidoru” who is a member of the “yunitto” AKATSUKI. As the descendant of a samurai clan, I’ve a sword on one side and a mindfulness of “tii-pii-ooh”2 on the other!”
“...... To tell you the truth, I’m not sure I understand what being someone’s “oshi” really entails yet. However, I imagine it’s similar to a samurai’s pledge of devotion to their lord.”
“I’ll show you that I’m a splendid “aidoru” worthy of your support. I hope that you will cheer for me….~♪”

 Tetora Nagumo

 “Ossu, I’m Nagumo Tetora! I’m in STARMAKER PRODUCTION’s RYUSEITAI!”
&quot;My hobby is doing workouts like weight-training, and my specialty is cooking the manliest food over an open flame. I’m always in the thick of it, working hard and growing in order to become a man among men~♪&quot;
“No matter what hardship knocks me down, I’ll show you that I can stand right back up and overcome it all. That’s how I wanna move forward as an idol too, step by step!”
“I’ll definitely become an idol so great, you’ll be glad that you chose me, so… I hope that you can support me…!”

 Midori Takamine

 “I’m Takamine Midori from RYUSEITAI. Umm, I’m not too sure what to talk about here, but I’ll try…”
“My family runs a greengrocer business, and I help them out often. Because of that, I like vegetables quite a bit… Ah, but the thing I love most is yuruchara~♪”
“On the other hand, I have a lot of things I’m not a fan of… Ah, but maybe I shouldn’t mention those right now. I’m sorry, I always get negative so easily…”
“I haven’t shown much appeal at all, but I’ll do as best as I can in my own way, so… If it’s alright, I’d be happy to have your support…♪”

 Shinobu Sengoku

 “I’m Sengoku Shinobu, a member of RYUSEITAI! I’m a ‘ninja’, so I devote myself to training and discipline day after day.”
“It’s difficult to explain in a few words why I chose to be a ninja, but… From a young age, I have always admired the ninja’s way of life, and so I aspired to become one myself~♪”
“Ninjas may be ones who conceal themselves, but I’m not simply a ninja — I’m an idol as well! So I always put everything I have acquired in my ninja training to good use, even on stage!”
“It would make me happy if you watched my acrobatic performances, and chose me as your ‘oshi’~♪”

 Chiaki Morisawa

 “The hero of justice, Morisawa Chiaki—! Has just made his arrival! …Mhm, I got that pose down perfectly! ☆”
“Alongside my comrades in RYUSEITAI, I work hard in my activities every day, both as a hero and as an idol!”
“I want to make everyone smile, and that feeling is stronger and more passionate than anyone else’s. I strive to always keep it that way. And the source of that burning passion is none other than the encouraging cheers of our fans!”
“That’s why I’d like you to send me your support by calling for my name as loud as you can! I’m counting on you!”

 Kanata Shinkai

 “hello~♪ i am shinkai kanata from ryuseitai.”
“i love the ocean, so i often take walks on the [beach] and [bathe] in [water]. i also love [fishies]~♪”

”to give your life a plentiful amount of [replenishment] as well, i will deliver many [songs] to you.”

“so i would love it if you would cheer for me. puka, puka…♪”

Kanata Shinkai


the blue flame is the mark of mystery! i have come from the blue sea~♪ ryusei blue! kanata shinkai…☆ (sparkle) ehehe, i tried introducing [myself]. i perform as part of the [unit] ryuseitai, alongside chiaki and the other members~♪

the [weather] is very nice today, which makes it the ideal weather for a [soak]…♪ i really love [water] and [fishies]. eating [fishies] is delicious, too. i also love [soy sauce]. having it on a platter of [sashimi] is simply the best~♪ 
it’s about time to feed the [fishies] in the [clubroom]. puka, puka…♪

Keito Hasumi

I’m Keito Hasumi. Alongside Kiryu and Kanzaki, I perform as part of AKATSUKI, a Japanese-style unit that honors traditional performance. I juggle that with my responsibilities as vice president of the student council as well. 
Apart from having lunch, I usually patrol the school during lunch break too, but today I was able to take my time eating. I’m very fond of spicy food, but the mapo eggplant at the cafeteria isn&#39;t spicy enough, so I’m always left feeling unsatisfied. 
Well, I have student council work to attend to soon, so you’ll have to excuse me. I think Eichi just abandoned his duties and is loafing around elsewhere… Having a troublesome childhood friend just exhausts me with worry… Honestly, how incorrigible.

Chiaki Morisawa

I&#39;m the burning heart Chiaki Morisawa! I’m Yumenosaki Academy’s ally of justice, RYUSEITAI’s leader, and captain of the basketball club all rolled into one! 
Today, during lunch break, I got to invite Sagami-sensei to RYUSEITAI’s lessons, and it was even more fruitful than usual!
Since Basketball Club activities happen after classes, I was thinking of inviting the other members out after practice! I thought Akehoshi, Isara, Takamine and I could get my favorite: french fries. There’s no one out there that hates something as yummy as fries! 
Deepening our bonds while eating tasty food... That&#39;s what youth&#39;s all about! Fuhahahaha! ☆

Shinobu Sengoku

Shinobu Sengoku has arrived! I&#39;m a part of RYUSEITAI as RYUSEI Yellow~♪ On top of that, I’m also the chief head of the Ninja Association… And for the sake of becoming a splendid ninja, I strive to train hard every day! 
The ninja fortune I got this morning said that if I completely master making ninja meals, I’ll have good luck coming my way! I’m a sucker for sour foods, so I’ll make a new ninja dish with my prized umeboshi! 
Right then, I’ve got to carry out a mission Isara-dono requested of me, so I shall take my leave! Shutatatata…!

Midori Takamine

Ah, hello… I&#39;m Midori Takamine from RYUSEITAI. I, well... I accidentally took the idol course exam and passed it for some reason… Then Morisawa-senpai invited me to RYUSEITAI, and he insisted that I join the Basketball Club too, since I had the &quot;height&quot; apparently… 
Like, for some reason, he&#39;s always getting involved with me to a suffocating degree… Sigh, this is so depressing. I wanna die… 
But I have the day off from both unit and club activities today, so I&#39;m thinking of going to my favorite yuruchara cafe. They&#39;ve got pizza on the menu... Here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s got basil on top...♪ 
Ugh— I think I hear Morisawa-senpai&#39;s voice from over that side. I have to escape before he catches me…

Kuro Kiryu

Yo. I’m Kuro Kiryu, captain of the karate club. I’m also the second in command of AKATSUKI, a Japanese-themed unit. Though, sayin’ “I’m an idol” with this sorta face isn’t all that believable, is it?
My favorite bite ta eat? Gotta be steak. I always hafta eat meat before every match ‘n live performance to fire myself up. 
But the other day, my lil’ sister just about threw a fit ‘cuz I ended up eatin’ too much of it… I want my lil’ sis to get her nutrition, so I try to keep that balance, but I accidentally end up bein’ careless about it when it comes to my own meals.
Well, time I get back to makin’ the outfits for our next live soon. This was a nice change of pace. Thanks.

Souma Kanzaki

Souma Kanzaki has arrived! I am affiliated with AKATSUKI, the distinguished powerhouse unit of Yumenosaki Academy. Additionally, I am a member of the Marine Life Club. 
Tomorrow, we are holding a “sushi paatee” to express our constant appreciation for Buchou-dono. ♪ There are many preparations to put together tonight, but that frivolous man… There is the issue that Hakaze-dono will not help at all.
Mm, it’s nearly time for my training… Well, please excuse me, I must be off! H-Hasumi-dono!? That’s right, today was unit practice. I am deeply sorry! I will apologize for this mistake with seppuku…! 

Tetora Nagumo

Ossu! I’m a first-year student in the Karate Club. The name’s Tetora Nagumo, and I’m Ryusei Black in RYUSEITAI! My hobby’s workin’ out, and I respect Taishou tons! Ah– By Taishou, I’m talkin’ about Kiryu-senpai. He’s a third-year, and he’s like, a totally amazing person!
I aim to be a man among men just like Taishou! I gotta get strong and cool like him as soon as I possibly can, so today’s another day I give everything my all. 
I’m gonna give my studies, my idol activities and my club activities everything I got! That’s why I’ll eat tons’a meat too, my favorite! Men grow stronger by eating meat!
That reminds me— Yesterday, Taishou told me that the kalbi meal set came back. I&#39;m gonna rush to the cafeteria now~!

                        I'm a huge fan of Akatsuki being absolute silly-billies, and I love seeing Tetora get to be silly with them. If you like this story, you should read Tough Guy, where Kuro gets silly with Tetora, Chiaki and Midori.

Onigashima Chapter 1

    Season: Winter


    Location: Dojo


 Hm? The dojo’s empty. That guy Tetsu didn’t come yet?
(And I’m just gonna… bow in front of altar.)
Alright, I’ll start ahead of him. If I start practicin’, Tetsu’ll be here before I know it.
… Ha! There! Ha! Take that!1
… It’s no good. My thoughts are distracting me from doin’ the proper kata forms…
I thought my head would clear out if I got my body movin’, but I’m still stuck in a rut. I just can’t get into practice like this.
I’m settin’ a bad example doin’ somethin’ this, aren’t I?
(Tellin’ anyone else about it is tough, though… At the end of the day, I gotta do somethin’ about it myself.)
…… But. I keep havin’ second thoughts, or like… I feel at a loss, I guess.
How fuckin’ pathetic, get a grip. There are guys who look up to me ‘n put their hopes on me.
Ahh… It’s not in my nature to worry this much about things……


(Cleanin’ took so long, I’m super late~! Taishou’s2 probably practicing already?)
(Even though just about all the third-years retired from club activities already, Taishou shows up for the sake of passin’ on the club.)
(Thanks to that, I get to work on throwing and grappling3 with Taishou!)
(Don’t get me wrong, it&#39;s fun to do that with other club members too, but Taishou’s in a league of his own, so wrestling with him is the most fun!)
(Recently, he’s been having grappling matches with me more than he used to. Guess it means I’m bein’ recognized by Taishou~♪)
(Alright! Let&#39;s get fired up and do our best today too! I won&#39;t say I’ll get a win, but at the very least I wanna be able to get some points.)

There! Ha!

(Ahh, it sounds like Taishou’s gotten a headstart on practice~ I can feel his fighting spirit eminatin’ from the dojo!)
(Heheh~♪ Am I allowed to play a little prank on Taishou and surprise him~? Like makin’ a loud noise or something?)

(Will he get angry? But I barely ever see Taishou get surprised, so I kinda wanna see it.)
(Lemme juuust take a peek inside and scope it out…)


(Ah, he really is practicing right now. … Hm? Taishou’s movements are kinda slower than usual today……?)

…… Guess it’s like I thought. There’s nothing left to do but dispose of ‘em.

...!?
(Eh? Ehhh…!? Was that seriously Taishou who said that just now!?)
(Dispose? Who will dispose who…!? Erm, it’s Taishou sayin’ it, so that means he’s gonna get rid of someone, right?)
(No, no, no, no…… There&#39;s no way Taishou would say something so disturbing! I musta heard it wrong!)
(Ahaha. It’s just like me to jump to the wrong conclusion~ To be a man among men, you gotta take it slow and steady.)
(Just take a deep breath and compose yourself… In… out…)
(Ossu, I calmed down a lot~)
(Let’s check again. Taking another peek insiiiide…)

All I wanted was to just let this go, but if things keep goin’ this way, the people I cherish are gonna get hurt.
There’s nothin’ else I can do about it at this point. Next time I meet up with those guys, it’s time for them to pay up!

...!?
(UwaaAAAAA!! I definitely didn’t mishear him!)
(He clearly said it&#39;s time for them to pay up! This time, I listened real carefully with my ears!)
(What does he mean by that!? I-Is it possible that Taishou’s really planning to settle his scores with someone…)
(Ummm, ummm~? Wh-What should I do!? Stop him!? Support him!?)
(No, think rationally, I can’t support him doing that!? Aaah, I&#39;m getting more and more confused, I can&#39;t handle this all by myself…!?)
(Ah, that’s it. Hasumi-senpai! If I just consult Hasumi-senpai……!)
(At this time of day, he should be in the student council room. Right, I gotta head there quickly!)
(Taishou! Don’t be too hasty yet~!)

It feels like there’s been some rustlin’ goin’ on outside for a while now…? Maybe Tetsu came?
Oi, Tetsu. Why aren’t you comin’ in… Wait, no one’s here. Was I imagining things?
Hm? Isn’t this Tetsu’s bag? Did he come here after all? Why’d he drop his bag here, then…?


    Location: Student Council Room


Hasumi-dono4 , how about you take a small break? Haven’t you been working nonstop?

Hm? Ahh, so much time has passed already…? Don’t worry. Thanks to your help, Kanzaki, I’m at a stopping point.

Is that right? I’m glad to hear that!
By the way, may I ask why you were doing student council work, Hasumi-dono?
You were working when I came, so I offered to help in spite of myself, but… Haven’t you already passed on the work to the other members?

The main things have been finished and passed on, but I’m just so used to this work after doing it for so long. I feel uneasy when I have nothing to do.
That&#39;s why I thought I&#39;d do an after-action report on Chocolat Fes5 from the other day, but… it seems I just got absorbed in it.
Rather, Kanzaki. Why did you also come here to help me as you always do in the first place?

Me? Erm… Now that you mention it…
I’m also the type to get uneasy when I have nothing to do, so I rushed in to help you as I usually do, Hasumi-dono!

I have issues with moderation, but you’re just as bad, huh? We’ve reached a stopping point, so maybe it’s time for some tea or something.

If that’s the case, I will brew it! I would like Hasumi-dono to take it easy…♪

Sorry to make you do this.

……—npa~i!

Hm? It sounded like someone just called for me? The hallway is noisy, isn’t it?

Ah, now that you mention it… Aren’t those footsteps?
It seems they’re coming towards this room at a tremendous pace!?

Hasumi-senpai! S-Something terrible is happening~!

Onigashima Chapter 2

(Gulping, gulping) …… Whew~! My nerves finally settled down! Thanks for the tea, Kanzaki-senpai!

Mhm, it was my pleasure to serve it. I’m glad I was brewing tea at the right moment.

You’re utterly hopeless! I don’t know what happened, but who in their right mind would just tear down the halls like that!?
The student council routinely cracks down on such an offense, you know! If people heard that someone had run into the student council room, we would be utterly humiliated!

I-I’m so sorry! I was so panicked and got carried away…!

… Well? What business do you have that warrants you coming here so breathless?

Ah! It&#39;s the terrible thing I was talking about! I came to ask Hasumi-senpai for advice— and the fact that Kanzaki-senpai’s here too is just my luck!
See, when I went for my club activities, I noticed that Taishou had gotten to the dojo earlier than me. Then I happened to overhear him talkin’ to himself about some real disturbing things…
Stuff like “There’s nothing left to do but dispose of ‘em” and “It’s time for them to pay up”......
That&#39;s why I thought maybe Taishou was planning on having them pay a “little visit” to the maker6... What the heck do you think I should do?

Kiryu said that? That’s ridiculous. There&#39;s no way that&#39;s the case with him.

Really? I don’t think it&#39;s out of the question that Kiryu-dono would do something like that, though.
I wonder what kind of wish came true for Kiryu-dono? As expected of a warrior, he never forgets to be grateful to the gods and Buddha!

Huh…? Gods and Buddha…?

… Kanzaki. The “maker” Nagumo’s talking about isn’t what you’re thinking of.
That saying is used to mean that someone intends to “retaliate”.

What!? Retaliate…? Kiryu-dono would never do something like that! Are you trying to make light of Kiryu-dono’s nature, Nagumo!?

N-No, that’s not it! I don&#39;t think Taishou would do something like that either!
But I heard what I heard… At first I thought I heard it wrong, but when I checked again, I heard him say something disturbing again…

Calm down, both of you. I don’t think Kiryu would do that either… but I hardly think Nagumo is one to lie either.

That’s… That’s true, but……

I swear I&#39;m not lying! A man among men would never do that. Hasumi-senpai, Kanzaki-senpai, please believe me!
Point is, after I heard all’a that, I freaked out and didn’t know what to do…
That’s when it came to me to ask Hasumi-senpai, so that’s why I hurried to the student council room.

Hm…
(I certainly don&#39;t think Kiryu would do something like that...)
(But Nagumo&#39;s acting like this. I don’t think it’s a misunderstanding, it&#39;s probably true that he heard it…..)
(What on earth could this mean...? Is Kiryu really going to…?)

We will not be able to come to an agreement with our thoughts in distress! This situation calls for an emergency strategy meeting to be held!

… Hah? An emergency strategy meeting…?

This feels like something RYUSEITAI would usually do, but I agree! I want some kinda strategy to get to the bottom of this!

Yes. Well said, Nagumo! With that settled, let’s write the topic of discussion on this “waito-boodo”!7
“Regarding Kiryu-dono’s mysterious behavior… What should we do?”

O-Oi. Don&#39;t proceed with the conversation as you please…

I&#39;m not really good at usin’ my head, but I’ll think a whole bunch for Taishou’s sake~

Come now, Hasumi-dono, you too! We want you to guide us as our consultant! I want all of us to come up with a plan together!

………

At any rate, I think we should start by sorting out the situation!

  U~myu. What I said earlier was almost all of what happened, but…
Umm. When I went to club activities, Taishou was there practicing first. I wanted to spook him a little, so I quietly scoped it out.
Then Taishou said, “Guess it’s like I thought. There’s nothing left to do but dispose of ‘em.”...
At first I thought I musta heard it wrong, so I peeked in again and he said, “Next time I meet up with those guys, it’s time for them to pay up.”
That&#39;s when I came here in such a hurry...
Wait, ahhh—!? I was in such a hurry that I left my bag outside the dojo. Well, it only has my textbooks in it…

Textbooks are the most important thing you could have, for goodness’ sake…. Just what do you think your duty is as a student?
In any case, hmm… No matter how many times I hear it, I still can&#39;t connect it to Kiryu. Many things may have happened in the past, but I can’t imagine him doing anything like that in the current day.
But… that&#39;s right. At times like this, it&#39;s a matter of reversing logic.

Reversing logic… In other words, under what scenario would Kiryu-dono need to take such action?

Under what scenario…? Ah! Now that you mention it! That&#39;s what Taishou said! “If things keep goin’ this way, the people I cherish are gonna get hurt.”
Maybe Taishou’s trying to get the jump on them to protect someone...!

Why didn&#39;t you lead with that!?

Heheh, sorry. The horror was so strong from all the horrible things Taishou was saying, I totally forgot about it.

Well, then that&#39;s the reason. If that&#39;s the case, it makes sense that Kiryu would try to make a move. I suppose this is him trying to protect us or someone else at the academy.
But I&#39;m sure he thinks it’ll cause us trouble, so he’s worrying about this all by himself…
Will he ever do something about that side of his? How completely hopeless.

However, trouble is out of the question at a time like this, even if he has a good reason for it, like protecting someone.
I can&#39;t let that guy&#39;s efforts go to waste in the end. I’ll keep that from happening no matter the cost.

Ossu! Of course!

I’m in agreement too. However, while our aim is to stop it, we won’t be able to do much if we don’t know who he’s trying to attack, no?

To start with, since it seems like Taishou’s friends might get affected too, the enemy has to have a real deep grudge against him, right?
If that’s true, they should just pick a fight with Taishou and nobody else..

It’s possible that the opponent can&#39;t beat Kiryu with a direct attack, so they’re trying to use underhanded methods instead.
Well, given the situation and how Kiryu was acting, it certainly seems like they have a strong grudge against him.

Taishou is strong, after all. But they’ve gotta be someone holding a constant resentment for Taishou, right? Is there anyone like that around?

A grudge… Kiryu is a reputable person, though, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone who would hold a grudge against him.
A lot happened in this academy in the old days, but most of the people from that time have already left this school.
Now, of the remaining students, there are probably more people who are grateful to Kiryu than not.

Yeah, I bet. That’s how I felt at the time of the Dragon King Competition!8 It made me think like, wow, everybody cherishes Taishou~

Hmph. At the time, I was extremely busy participating in another event, and the academy was empty too. I simply just didn&#39;t realize it was going on at the time.
Had I known in advance, I would have definitely put a stop to it.

Mhm. There was suddenly a job to do at the time.
But, hmmm... If that&#39;s the case, could it perhaps be an old familiar face? Someone he knew before entering this academy……

Hmm... I’m not saying it isn’t possible, but I&#39;ve never seen him with someone like that.

I don’t think so either. I see Taishou all the time, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him meet up with anyone like that before.

As I figured. I have no recollection of Kiryu-dono ever being with such a person as well.
No. If we keep speculating like this, we will never reach the truth! Why don’t we ask Kiryu-dono about all of this directly?

Denied. If we do that and make Kiryu suspicious of us, it’s likely he’ll just lie to cover up the truth.
And if Kiryu sneaks around about it, it’ll be even harder to pin down the other party.

Which means... Maybe watching over Taishou would be the best way of goin’ about it? Keepin’ an eye on him if he acts weird and stopping him if it seems like he’s gonna head to the other person?

… I feel ashamed that I’d be monitoring my friend, but I suppose it’s the only way. You can’t solve a problem without making a sacrifice. Let’s go with that plan.


    Location: Hallway


(I&#39;ve been thinking about it since I heard Nagumo&#39;s story yesterday, but there really are still too many things that don’t make sense to me…...)
(I don&#39;t think Kiryu’s that good at hiding things in the first place.)
(If he was planning to do something like that, I’d think one of us would have noticed something was off.)
(But, well, it&#39;s not like we’re always paying attention to things like that. It&#39;s possible that we missed it.)
(At any rate, I won’t be as careless now, so if Kiryu does anything suspicious I’m sure I’ll notice it right away.)
(I figured that I’d check in on Class 3-B every break between classes, but I didn’t see any signs of something being off with Kiryu… Maybe Nagumo&#39;s worries were unfounded after all?)
(I do feel like we’ve been worrying about this too much, the more I think about it. I’m sure Kiryu’s just the same as always on this break too…)
(Wh-What!? Kiryu’s not here…!?)
Where’d he go!? Did he really go to see that other person!?
Kh… I was careless! To think I’d lose sight of Kiryu in such a small span of time……!

Didja need somethin’ from me, Hasumi-no-danna?9

K-Kiryu! Wh-Where on earth did you…!?

It’s break time, so I thought it was a good time to go to the bathroom? Was it really that urgent? What’s up?

Eh!? N-No… That’s…

……? What’s the matter? You’re speakin’ unusually stiff and sharp, danna. Is it somethin’ you can’t say here?

No, that’s not really… Erm, you see…
C-... Could you lend me your textbook……? The, erm… mathematics one……

…………
Haha. Sure, gimme a sec.

…………

Here, you can take it with ya.
Hasumi-no-danna makes mistakes like that too, huh? Leavin’ stuff behind? Makes ya look like a real student, doesn’t it? Hahaha.

Gh… If you hadn&#39;t caused a fuss in the first place, I wouldn&#39;t need to tell such a lie…

Mn? What’d ya say?


Nothing! I’ll be borrowing this, just so you know! I appreciate it!

…? Yeah, don’t worry about it.

Onigashima Chapter 4

    Location: Dojo


Ha! Like that! Ha!

…… (Staring without blinking)

There! Hoo…! Ha!

…… (Staring without blinking)

… Kanzaki. I appreciate yer enthusiasm, but it’s seriously distractin’ that you’re sittin’ in seiza and starin’ at me at the edge of the dojo.
It doesn’t help that you’ve got an intense way about it. Somethin’ about that keeps making my eyes dart to you.

Please don’t mind my presence! Please think of me as a Jizo statue10 or something of the sort!

That’s quite a fierce presence for a Jizo… What is it? What’s with you suddenly wanting to watch my practice? Have you finally awoken to karate too, Kanzaki?

No, I&#39;m a samurai through and through, this sword cannot leave my side.
I certainly think it&#39;s good to have a strong body that can fight without a sword, but no matter! It simply means I must never relinquish this sword at any given moment!
It&#39;s no exaggeration to say that this sword and I are one and the same!

Then, why’re you watching me practice?

Ugh…! This is a mission of mine……

Mission? What d’ya mean?

Ah, no! As samurai, we have a family rule that requires us to train every day, so today, my training shall be learning through observation of Kiryu-dono&#39;s physical handling!

If that’s the case, shouldn’t we do somethin’ like kendo instead of karate? You’re a samurai, aren’t you?

Ughgh……
(If I say anything more, I&#39;m going to let slip what we’re doing… If only Nagumo was here at a time like this...!)
N-now that I think about it, is Nagumo not here? I haven&#39;t seen him around today. Will he be coming soon?

Didja have business with Tetsu? Seems like he had a lesson with RYUSEITAI, so I don&#39;t think he’s comin’ here? If ya got business with Tetsu, why don’t ya let me pass on a message?

(How could this be…!? I can’t believe he’s confined to unit practice today of all days… I can&#39;t call Nagumo for back-up on this.)

Kanzaki? What’s with the gloomy face? Did somethin’ happen with you and Tetsu?

No, it&#39;s not that I had any matter to do with Nagumo in particular. I just feel like I’d be saved if Nagumo were here…

What d’ya mean, being saved? Were you guys that close…? Well, it&#39;s a good thing you and Tetsu are startin’ to get on good terms, though.

Regardless, I would like to sit aside and watch Kiryu-dono train.
Or is my being here a nuisance to you after all…?

No, you’re not gettin’ in the way or anything... Good grief, when ya get so modest out of nowhere, it makes me lose my bearings.
I got it. No prob. Tetsu’s not comin’, but watch as much as ya like, Kanzaki.

Really!?

It’s hard to do anything when you’re starin’ at me like you were a second ago, but……
Oh, I know. I’ll keep on practicing, so why dontcha practice some swordsmanship too? Do some practice swings or somethin’, the dojo’s nice and spacious. Let’s practice together~♪

What!? Do you really mean it, Kiryu-dono, training with you…!?
Ah, no, but…
(My mission is to watch over Kiryu-dono…)
(Well, since we are together, I suppose I can fulfill my duty while I practice with him….?)
Mrm~…

What’s wrong? You’re not in the mood?
Actually, I wanna know how to use a sword ‘cause of reasons. That&#39;s why I thought I&#39;d watch your swordsmanship, Kanzaki. Is it alright if I do or is it no-go?

Oh, wow! If that&#39;s the case, do let me be of help to you! Kiryu-dono, please watch to your heart’s content until you’ve had your fill~♪
Let&#39;s get started right away, Kiryu-dono!

Onigashima Chapter 5

    Location: Dojo


(U~myu… It&#39;s been a few days since our emergency strategy meeting, but Taishou hasn’t been doin’ anything suspicious.)
(Hasumi–senpai and Kanzaki-senpai have been on the lookout for Taishou too, but he just seems the same as usual… Even in club activities, he&#39;s the same Taishou as always.)
(I must’ve gotten the wrong idea after all…? That’d be relieving to know if that’s the case.)
(Maybe I should ask Taishou straight up– somethin’ like, “Hey, what were you saying to yourself the other day?”)
(And then he’ll burst out laughing outta nowhere and say somethin’ like “Ah, Tetsu, you misunderstood”...)
(Huh, what’s that? Is that Taishou all the way over there?)

......

(Why’s he in a place like this? That’s behind the school building, right?)
(He&#39;s holdin’ something long, but I can’t tell what it is…? And he’s even sneaking around avoidin’ people&#39;s attention.)
(...This is way too suspicious~! I gotta catch up and follow him!)


(I’m pretty sure Taishou headed this way… Ah, I found him!)

Err… Kanzaki waved it around like this…
Ha!

(Th-That long thing was a sword!? He’s finally got a weapon for when he–!?)
Ahh~!

Whoa!? You surprised me!

(C-Crap! He looked so prepared for a fight that I couldn&#39;t help but cry out!)

Tetsu? What’re you doing here?

Ummm~? Ummm~...? I-I… I’m a little lost… on the… road called life……?
…… Hah? Are you alright? You’re not runnin’ a temperature are ya, Tetsu?

I&#39;m fine, there’s no need to worry about me! What are you doin’ in a place like this, Taishou!?

M-Me? I was just… exercising, really…

Exercising… ? Why so suddenly, Taishou? You even got your hands on a sword!

This is, that… Apparently it&#39;s an exercise that’s been passed down in the Kanzaki family for generations.

(I&#39;ve never heard of such an exercise! Also, you just hid your sword, didn’t you!?)

Well, you don’t have to mind me either. I just wanted to get a lil’ workout goin’ is all.

Workout… Can’t you exercise to your heart’s content during club activities after classes are over?

Huh? Ah… That’d be the actual match, though. What I’m doin’ right now is kinda like warm-up exercises for it.

(Taishou, you&#39;ve been dodgin’ every question so far! No matter how you slice it, this is as shady as I thought!)
Taishou! Um…!

Hm? What’s up?

(I want to ask Taishou directly, but I made a promise to Hasumi-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai...)
(If I ask here, Taishou will find out that we’re suspicious of him…..)

Tetsu…? Seriously, what’s wrong? You worried about somethin’?

(Taishou… Isn’t Taishou the one with the worries? Why won’t he talk to any of us about it?)
(Uu~uu! I absolutely won’t let you go give that guy payback!)
…… Taishou! From now on, please stay with me!11 I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to stop you, Taishou! UUOOOOHH!!

Whoa!? Don’t cling to me outta nowhere, Tetsu. You freaked me out.
So by that, you want me to stay at your place with ya? Is that what you were worried about?
“Stay with me forever”... You want me to stay over with you ‘cuz yer lonely without your parents tonight? Is that it?
Haha, I thought you were growin’ up, but you still say such kiddy things, dontcha?
What happened? Didja watch a scary show on TV or somethin’? My lil’ sister sometimes watches ‘em too, and she sticks to me when she gets scared.

Uuu… I think there’s a huge misunderstandin’ here, but that works too... Just please, Taishou, stay with me!

I’d love to stay by your side and everythin’, but not today, sorry. I’ve got somethin’ to do tomorrow, so maybe another time, Tetsu.

(...! Taishou saying that means... M-Maybe tomorrow is the day he goes through with it…!?)

Onigashima Chapter 6

    Location: Shopping District


(Yawning)

What? Did you not get enough sleep, Nagumo?

Sorry. My mind wouldn’t stop racin’ about Taishou carrying out his plan today, so I didn’t get much sleep… (Yawn)

I understand how you feel. I had a hard time falling asleep because my mind was racing over it too.

Oi, the reason we’re here is to stop Kiryu. Don&#39;t speak in a way that sounds like we intend to back him up.

I’m aware! But who knows what will happen!
Being well prepared gives you no reason to worry. And today, my sword is in flawless shape far more than usual! I used some of my finer sword oil for the first time too~♪

Oi, Kanzaki. Could you not start being suspicious either? Kiryu’s causing me enough of a headache on his own.
At any rate, Nagumo, will Kiryu really pass through here?

Yesterday, I scoped out Taishou’s movements, so judging from that he should be here already!
Honestly, I wanted to stake out Taishou’s house, but obviously I’d stick out too easily there.

Well, I’d say that was a wise call. The best place to hide a tree is in the forest.
And thankfully, today is a holiday. It’ll be harder for him to sense us shadowing him if there’s this much foot traffic.
But what will we do if Kiryu had actually noticed our plan and given us false information?

I think we’re fine there!
I called Taishou’s house a while back to find out what time he’d leave, and his little sister told me he’d already gone out!

Oh? You came thoroughly prepared. I thought you’d get flustered and not be able to do anything.

Of course I did! This is the one day I can’t fail at any cost!

Before you get distracted by trivial talk, please look over there! Kiryu-dono has arrived!

Ah! Taishou! He’s holding something long today, too. I’m not really sure, but I think it&#39;s a sword. He was secretly practicing with a sword behind the school building yesterday, too.

That&#39;s certainly a sword bag. Now that I think about it, he said that he wanted to see my swordsmanship too……

Kiryu with a sword? He’s not Kanzaki, so what gives…?

Maybe he’s up against something he can’t beat with only his bare hands? Like, maybe there’s so many people that he has to bring a weapon to stand a chance, or something like that…

Even if that were the case, I think he’d probably fight with his bare hands to the very end.

Ah, both of you! Kiryu-dono is on the move! We have to follow after or we’ll lose sight of him!

Ahh—! Whatever the case might be, let’s go after Kiryu for now! If we follow him, it’ll tell us all we need to know.

Yeah!

…………

Hmm. From what I can see of him, he seems the same as always, doesn’t he?
If he’s really going to fight someone soon, he’d look way more intense… Surely it can’t be a situation where he can simply act as always…?

Oh yeah, hmm…? I don&#39;t think I’d be able to do this trick, but Taishou’s powerful so he’s probably a master at erasin’ any signs of hostility before he gets into a fight, I think?

Is that what it is? By all appearances, it just looks like he’s enjoying the shopping district, though…

Oh oh! Kiryu-dono is entering a store! That store’s… a “furawa-shoppu”?

A flower shop…? He’s buying a lovely bouquet…? Oi, what’s going on? Everything about this is utterly strange, no matter how you look at it.

…… Maybe it’s for a hospital visit?

Hah? Hospital visit…?

Well, he’s gonna end up pummelin’ the person he’s about to fight. The least he can do is apologize…?

I see. He puts his all even for the loser of a fight… I admire the depth of Kiryu-dono’s consideration!

That’s idiotic! Logically speaking, it’s clearly too out of place!

Ah! Taishou’s on the move again! Let’s just put this aside, we gotta go after him!

Right you are, let’s move! Swiftly! Secretly! Vanishing into thin air!

Oi, wait you guys!
Hah… Can’t you compose yourselves even just a little?

Huh? Taishou’s going into another store? This one looks like a stationery store, though.
He’s buying something again. This time it’s… origami paper? Seems he’s buyin’ quite a lotta it too.

Origami paper…? Just what does Kiryu plan to do with something like that?

Ha! I’ve got it! If the flowers from earlier were meant for a hospital visit, then this origami paper must be for a thousand-paper-crane chain!12
Isn&#39;t that essential for a hospital visit?

Ahh, you’re right! Are there any limits to Taishou’s kindness!? He’s wishing the person he’s fighting a swift recovery!

…… No, calm down, both of you. That can&#39;t be right. Something’s definitely off about this.
It doesn’t look like Kiryu’s on his way to beat someone up, and the things he’s buying along the way are completely unrelated to such an unsettling situation.
Besides, at the end of this road…
Ah, I see. So that’s what it is.


    Location: Residential Area


Eh!? Hasumi-senpai, did you happen to figure out where Taishou’s goin’? Everythin’ here is basically a residential area...

Yes. I can’t say I know why Kiryu is heading there, but I have an idea of what his destination is.

What!? Really? Hasumi-dono! Where on earth is Kiryu-dono heading?

You don’t recognize this road too, Kanzaki? I think it’s a place you&#39;ve been to before.

A place I’m familiar with? Oh oh, now that you mention it, I&#39;m sure that at the end of this road is—...

Onigashima Chapter 7

    Location: Residential Area


…… What on earth does this mean…?

Kiryu&#39;s destination was there after all, huh?

This is the same kindergarten where we had a puppet show before.13
Hmm, judging from appearances, Kiryu-dono is playing with the kindergarteners… Moreover, Anzu-dono’s with him for some reason.

Ummm, where’s he going for the payback visit? There&#39;s no way they&#39;d cause a scene in a place like this, so…?

I’m guessing we had some kind of huge misunderstanding, most likely.
Hm? Kiryu’s noticed us.

Hasumi-no-danna…? And that’s Tetsu and Kanzaki too. What&#39;re you guys doing in a place like this?

Taishou! Weren&#39;t you gonna get payback from someone today? Why are you playing with little kids?

Hah? Get payback? What d’ya mean?
Oh, lil’ miss. Tetsu and these guys came for some reason.
Mm? Ahh, yeah you’re right. There&#39;s no point standin’ around ‘n talkin’ in a place like this. You guys should come in. I gotta get ready soon too.

…… Get ready?


    Location: Kindergarten Classroom


It was my fault that we jumped to the wrong conclusion, I&#39;m so sorry!

Mmgh… I didn&#39;t realize it until the last second either, I’m so ashamed…

Sigh... I thought something was off half-way, but I never expected this to be the plot twist……
Lift your head, Nagumo. Kiryu was acting confusing from the get-go, so there’s blame to be had there too. I can see how you got the wrong idea.
I never would’ve guessed that Kiryu&#39;s monologue was a line from his play about Momotaro.14

Sorry for misleadin’ ya, Tetsu. I didn’t think anyone would hear me sayin’ my lines.

In other words, to summarize what Kiryu told us...
Due to the visit the other day, Nito got a request from the kindergarten for a play event.
And you’re saying that you accepted the request because Nito and the broadcast committee members were too busy to accept it for themselves, Kiryu?

Yeah. I didn&#39;t wanna disappoint the kids, and that&#39;s not what Nito’d want either.
But unlike other large-scale external projects like DreamFes, somethin’ like this doesn&#39;t bring much value to the unit.
It felt awkward thinkin’ about involvin’ AKATSUKI and other units, so I took it on myself.
As long as the request was taken, Nito’s reputation would be fine.
Nito always does a lotta things for me, so I thought I’d repay ‘im a lil’.
But even though I accepted the offer, I’m not that good at actin’ to begin with. For whatever reason, I get kinda embarrassed when I practice out in the open.15
So I was secretly practicin’ the lines for my sword fightin’ scene, and Tetsu misunderstood me ‘cuz of it.

You’re beyond saving! If you had just talked to us about this, none of this would have ever happened.
Good grief... I understand the gist of the situation, but why is Anzu here too?

Ahh. That it? Tetsu wasn’t the only one to see me practice my lines; lil’ miss saw me too. When I told her all about it, she offered to help me out. Right, miss?

Ah, I have no intention of blaming you, so don&#39;t apologize, Anzu.
This situation came from a comedy of errors. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anyone&#39;s fault.

So, today was the day of the event, and what we were tailing was Kiryu-dono buying souvenirs for the children along the way.

Ahh… But I&#39;m glad I was wrong~…
Ah! It’s not like I didn’t believe in you, Taishou! But, given the situation, I started to worry more and more.

To be fair, if someone was going to be harmed, you would be more than likely to take action.
In the first place, you always carry everything by yourself, and that’s how this misunderstanding happened. Reflect on that.

Haha, you’re not wrong. Sorry for worryin’ you guys so much — Hasumi-no-danna, Tetsu, Kanzaki.

Honestly, I’m just relieved that nothing happened.
Oh? It seems like the kindergarten teachers are calling Kiryu-dono for something?

Hm? You’re right. Is somethin’ the matter?
Ah, nah, these guys aren&#39;t members of the event. They’re more like my visitors…
Ah, that&#39;s right. It doesn’t change the fact I’m doin’ the whole play myself. I&#39;m plannin’ on having lil’ miss work on behind the scenes stuff.

Hm? Are there not enough people to do the play?

It’s just barely enough. I&#39;m Momotaro, and the rest of the roles are gonna be handled by the teachers.
But they gotta look after the kids too, so they don’t feel like they’ve got enough people around unless they do both jobs.
Well, it might be a complete frenzy behind the scenes, but it&#39;ll work out somehow.

You’re the cause for this whole mess in the first place, and yet you’re back to acting distant with us and carrying the burden by yourself again!
It feels wrong to just let things stay like this! If that&#39;s how things are, we&#39;ll take part, too!

Onigashima Chapter 8

    Location: Kindergarten Classroom


Lil’ miss, are ya done cleanin’ yet? Ah, you did? When I was straightenin’ up all the backstage scene stuff you got left with basically everything… Sorry ‘bout that.
The play was a huge success, huh? I didn&#39;t think the kids would love it that much.
Didja have fun too, lil’ miss? Yeah, that’s good. Danna ‘n the other two seemed happy to be surrounded by the kids too.
Mm? Ah, yeah you’re right. With how messy this turned out in the end, I shoulda done like you said and asked everyone for advice after all.
There’s not much reward to doing this, and while it wouldn’t be so bad if it were Nito’s Ra*bits, but AKATSUKI’s so far from this kinda audience, it felt hard to bring up.
But as ya said, those guys didn’t care about that kinda thing at all.
I could act like I knew what I was doin’, and relax, while those guys helped me out and supported me.
Haha. For sure. Maybe the kids loved the play so much ‘cuz the atmosphere was so relaxed from the get go.
The teachers really liked it too, so I finally felt good about it all.
I’m real grateful they liked it, but I got real nervous when they said they wanted me to come back next month ‘n do it again.
Eh? Oi, oi. Gimme a break, lil’ miss. Even though things turned out this way, I still had no clue what the hell I was doin’, y’know? Though, of course I wasn’t plannin’ on just throwin’ in the towel midway.
I was worried the kids would be disappointed if I was the one bein’ Momotaro. But, well, it seems they were pleased with it, so that was a relief.
“Don’t say that”...? Haha, Lil’ miss scolded me.
Nah, I didn’t mean to make fun of you, I was just thinkin’ you said it in a way that’s similar to when my lil’ sister gets mad at me for somethin’.
By the way, what happened to the other guys?
Ahh, it’s afternoon nap time for all the kids? They’re helpin’ out with that, then.
Mm? Lil miss is gonna go ‘n help the teachers? I’ll help out too, then. I was under your care today, so lemme do this much for ya.
Danna and the others are probably havin’ a harder time than you are…? Well, I guess so. There are a lot more people where they are.
Gotcha. I&#39;ll help Hasumi-no-danna’s group. I&#39;m sure it was the classroom next door, right?


Yo, Monkey-no-danna. Is there anythin’ I can help with?

Don&#39;t call me by the name of my role. There&#39;s nothing I need your help with in particular. The kids are finally asleep, so please just be as quiet as you can.

They got put to bed already? Guess I came too late to help, huh.

But, how incorrigible. Couldn’t something have been done a bit more with the casting?

Hm? You mean about how Tetsu was the dog, Kanzaki was the ogre, and Danna was the monkey? I thought it fit you guys pretty well, though.

If it were just the monkey, I’d understand, but why did I have to play the pheasant as well?

We didn’t have enough hands, so it couldn’t be helped. Besides, for that role, your job was to do ventriloquism while holdin’ the pheasant doll.
And you did a pretty fine job at that, Danna. Didn’t all the kids hound you for an encore afterwards?

Kh… it’s because I usually see that eccentric oddball’s tricks. It’s aggravating I got the hang of something as pointless as ventriloquism.

Tetsu and Kanzaki couldn’t do ventriloquism to that degree. They were just movin’ their lips like normal.
Hm? Come to think of it, what happened to Tetsu ‘n Kanzaki?

If you’re looking for the two of them, they were romping around with all the kids and making a racket. When the kids got put to bed, they fell asleep with them.

Zzz…… zzz……

…………

Ahh, you’re right. They’re mixed in with all the kids that’re sleepin’, huh?
I thought it was lil’ lonely that they were gettin’ all reliable on us, but seein’ ‘em like this, they’ve still got a bit of a kiddy part to them, huh?

Don’t say that. You made the two of them worry about you so much that they said that they were too nervous to sleep properly. They probably felt relieved enough to relax now.

Well, that was pretty bad on my part.

Absolutely. Reflect on yourself. Well, it was my fault too for not seeing through it….
Even if I believed it was true, I wouldn’t have guessed that you were practicing lines for a kindergarten event.

Yeah, true.
Hey, if I really did go after someone like that ‘n beat them as payback, what would you have done, Hasumi-no-danna?

Hah? Where’d that come from so suddenly? You wouldn’t do something like that in the first place.

I said what if. What if I did? I don’t plan to, but we don’t know the future, right?
I was wonderin’ what you’d do about it if I really went to go ‘n beat someone down?

…… I see. If that were the case, I’d give you a good wallop to stop you, even if it cost me my life.

………… Hasumi-no-danna, doing that...? Like, to win a square-on fight with me?

Didn’t I just say I’d do it even if it cost me my life?

Hahahaha. What, so you’re plannin’ on losin’? Come with a winnin’ attitude. You don’t sound sure of yourself at all.

Shut it. It’s a hypothetical, so it doesn’t matter if I win or lose. I know you wouldn’t do anything like that anyway.

Haha. Hey, Hasumi-no-danna. I’m a lucky guy, aren’t I? I’m surrounded by all these good guys who care about me.
I&#39;d love to show all&#39;a that to the old me. He’d be surprised for sure.

    Season: Spring


    Location: Garden Terrace


 Hello, Transfer Student-dono1. We’ve been seeing a lot of each other at “Gaaden Terasu” as of late, huh? Are you also having lunch?
Mm, food and health are inextricably linked.
I want you to eat a lot, get healthy, and produce us idols relentlessly…♪
As usual, I’m putting on the act as a chef. If you’d like, let me serve you some homemade food.
Also, I had so much fun chopping up the ingredients that I ended up preparing a lot of them...♪
Hm, that&#39;s what you intended? Because you want to save food costs? Hm, then there’s no need for my concern. Transfer Student-dono is such a strong woman!


 Splendid, bravo~♪ If you&#39;re happy with my cooking, I’d like you to eat it to your heart&#39;s content. May it become a source of energy for you!
Do you mind if I join you? It’s more pleasant to eat with a group~♪ Mm. Excuse me…
Hold on a moment. This is too much for one person to eat, but not enough for two people. Let’s finish cooking a little bit more.
Do you have any “reku-ests”? I’m getting tired of always eating seafood. I have some premium meat that Adonis-dono gave me, so maybe I’ll have that for t—…
Huh? — A scoundrel!

Eyaaa?! Wh-Wh– Why did a table get cut to pieces in front of me?!


I-I– I&#39;m definitely not a suspicious person! If you could just spare me my life…?!

Hm, who are you? What do you intend to do by sneaking around on the floor, you dodgy fellow?
Are you a thief? You lawless cad! For the sake of &quot;Gaaden Terasu&quot;, this Kanzaki Souma will inflict punishment upon you!

W-Wait a second! Why is this person wielding a Japanese sword as if it’s normal? This is a violation of the Firearms and Swords Act2!

Hmm, you are... I believe you are Sengoku from the Ninja Association. You. Are you acting suspicious again?
Good grief, it’s a complete nuisance. For some reason, people seem to think you’re close friends with me.

Huh, why? I&#39;m the type of ninja who doesn&#39;t have many close friends, though…
But it’s not that I can&#39;t make friends because I’m shy! Ninjas are like shadows, destined to live by erasing all traces of their very presence...!

Hmm. I’m samurai-like. You’re ninja-like. The public seems to think that samurai and ninja are birds of a feather.

Ehh!? Ninjas and samurai are completely different! But there were some ninjas who became feudal lords, so I guess it depends on the character of the region?
And um, Kanzaki-dono is more of a “swordsman” than a “samurai”, right?

Well, I&#39;m not interested in the distinction. However, the problem is that you and I are considered to be compatriots.
Whenever you do something strange, I get frowned upon, too. It’s better to live a more straightforward life, more pure and honest.
If you live right, instead of crawling around on the floor like that, you&#39;ll be able to face the sun with pride.


F-For some reason, I'm being scolded... Uu~? But I can’t relax in bright places, y’know~…?
… What on earth have you been doing since a while ago? You can eat while sitting on a chair. Ninjas seem like they’re completely unfamiliar with etiquette.
If you&#39;re hungry, I&#39;ll share some of my food with you.

Yaaay, I&#39;ve graduated from eating by myself~!
Ah, Transfer Student-dono was here too! I wonder if I&#39;ve interrupted your date...?

We’re simply “kurasumeito”. We just so happened to share a table today. Now that’s enough, it&#39;s time to eat. It&#39;s said that nausea dwells in an empty stomach.

Thank you, thank you...! I was running out of food allowance this month. Honestly, I was in trouble.
Also, here in Garden Terrace... I was doing a little fly-catching.


Well, now that I see it closely, it’s flypaper! You— Don&#39;t show those things while we’re eating! It’s unsanitary, I&#39;ll lose my appetite!
Are you going to eat it? Do you eat flies? As I thought, I can&#39;t understand ninjas...!

Hey, please don&#39;t draw your sword?! I’m not going to eat them~! These flies are meant to be frog food.

Fr-Frogs? Are you raising them as pets?

They’re more like friends than pets to raise~ Ninjas use dogs, birds, frogs, and the like.
But dogs bite, and birds nip with their beaks, so frogs are the best ones to get along with.
However, they&#39;re bigger eaters than they look. The cost of food is ridiculous, so that’s why I catch flies myself, if that makes sense...?

I-I see. That’s why you set foot for “Gaaden Terasu”. Certainly, those types of insects tend to gather in the dining hall.

That’s right~ Oops, found another fly! I&#39;ll capture it~☆

Don&#39;t mess around while you’re eating! Have you no manners!

Forgive me a million times over, but I&#39;m seriously in trouble. I can&#39;t let my frogs go hungry...
I&#39;m starving because I&#39;m cutting back on my own food expenses. Ninjas and samurai alike cannot fight if they are hungry.
So please give me your patience— hm hm! There are flies again~☆

Hey, that&#39;s annoying! Besides, flies have compound eyes. They have excellent dynamic vision, so you can&#39;t catch them with movements like that! Watch!
En garde–!3

Ooh, you caught a fly with chopsticks! That’s amazing...☆


Hehe. I don&#39;t try to pretend I’m as skilled as the ancient swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, but... for a well-trained martial artist, a target such as this is a breeze before breakfast. Ha! Take that! And that4!

Wow, that’s amazing! I want you to catch more, and I want you to teach me how to do it, too~♪

Heh, I don&#39;t hate being praised. But my training will be severe, you know.

Bring it on! Enduring all hardships is what makes a ninja—...
Ow?!


Ogh?! Wh-Why are you hitting us, Transfer Student-dono!
Huh, “Don&#39;t fool around while eating”...? That&#39;s right, this ninja managed to get me carried away!

Is it my fault?!
But well, I certainly don&#39;t think it would be a good idea to play with flies while we eat! Forgive me, Transfer Student-dono!

Hehe. Sengoku, you also call Transfer Student-dono &quot;Transfer Student-dono&quot;, huh?
It gives off the impression that we are samurai and ninja who serve the same master, so what say you and I get along better from now on?

I&#39;m so happy! Yaaay, I&#39;ve made a new friend... ♪ Transfer Student-dono brought us together!
I’m so thankful, I should call you “Lord&quot;5 instead of “Transfer Student-dono”! You are our master, Lord!

Lord, why have you stopped eating? Come come, eat as much as you like～♪

Lord～♪

Lord～☆


...Ow?! You hit me again! I suppose you’d rather be called “Princess” instead of “Lord”?

Hmm, a girl&#39;s heart is complicated...
Sengoku, if you&#39;re having trouble finding food for your frogs, come to the Marine Life Club room later. We may have some food stocked up, so I&#39;ll lend you a little.

Uwaa, that&#39;d save me trouble! But it&#39;s cool to catch flies with chopsticks too. I&#39;d be happy if you could teach me how to do it later~♪
Ehehe, I had a really fun lunchtime today! I am terribly grateful~♪

Epilogue 1

    Location: Tourist Village


Gentlemen, excellent work! Ah, that’s too insolent of me to say, when I am still only a novice… I’ll say “thank you for your hard work” instead～♪
Come now, enjoy the food to your heart&#39;s content.
The food used in the banquet scene is authentic. It would be a waste to let it rot and get thrown away, so I was told they’d like us to finish it up.
I hurried to get some additional food and drinks, so let&#39;s have a quick kick-off and enjoy ourselves~♪
Oh, by the way, we have permission to have a wrap-up party here.
The sponsors were very happy that Scroll of the Elements was a great success~♪

How are you so energetic, Kanzaki...? I&#39;m completely exhausted.
It was a slapstick comedy this time around, so my face hurts from overusing facial muscles that don’t typically get practice.

Yeah, what he said. My face got so stiff that it isn’t goin’ back to normal...
Plus, the focus was on sword-fighting and action scenes for this performance. Kanzaki and I are fine for the most part, but Hasumi-no-danna, are you feelin’ groggy from it all?

Don’t look down on me. I don&#39;t want to hold you guys back, so I go on runs to train.
It feels good to run early in the morning. I can feel the change of seasons, too.

That makes you sound like a grandpa…
Well done to everyone in RYUSEITAI, too. We were in sync way more than I expected, and it was pretty fun. Let&#39;s perform together again~♪

I should be the one to say that to you guys. We got to experience something extremely valuable, and thanks to you all, Scroll of the Elements was made possible.
Thank you for making my comrade’s dreams come true.

Hmph. It&#39;s still autumn, it would be bad if you burnt out here.
The organizers said that if things keep going like this, they would like to consider holding additional performances or releasing a second round... There may also be an opportunity to do a similar live in the future.

i’m looking forward to it~ next time, i want to play the role of [samurai-san], too~
the other day, souma taught me how to use a [katana]~♪1

It’s risky to let Buchou-dono handle blades, so I’d rather he doesn’t, but…
I&#39;ve grown a little interested in ninjas, too. Why don&#39;t you teach me the basics next time, Sengoku?

Zzz… zzz…~♪

Oh, Sengoku fell asleep. He must be exhausted, he sleeps like a baby... He worked hard today, after all~♪

Ahaha. Yet on stage, or rather, in the final scene, he looked so powerful and cool.
He actually genuinely managed to pass through the ring of fire. It was a real surprise to see.

He really is light on his feet, huh... Tetora:-kun is pretty athletic, too — I feel like I’m the only one who looks like a dunce...
Maybe I&#39;m lanky because I only eat vegetables… I need to take in more protein...

Oh, you got so inspired by your comrades that it made you wish to grow stronger!? Takamine is a boy too, huh~ That feeling is important!
That’s wonderful! Keep encouraging each other to improve yourselves, you guys...☆

Wait— please don&#39;t cling to me... Right after performances, Morisawa-senpai’s body-temperature is about three times higher than normal, and it’s so stuffy...

It’s fine, isn’t it? Let’s get along! Let&#39;s share our happiness!
Now that Sengoku has done what he wants to do, it might be Takamine&#39;s turn next, y’know? Is there anything you want to do?

Uu~... Right now, I just want to go home and sleep in bed...

What a silly comedy this is, like Manjuu Kowai.2 Alright, that’s all from me. I’ll take my leave now, so onto the next speaker.

Epilogue 2

… Anzu-dono, you’re standing a little far away for some reason, but…
You should come closer. Here, the chestnut yokan is delicious~♪
…You have such a sad look on your face. What’s the matter? If you’d like, you can talk to me.
We’re “kurasumeito”, I want you to rely on me anytime~♪
Hmm. You feel disappointed in yourself because you misjudged what distance to take with us “aidoru”?
Sengoku told you that he was neither a stuffed animal nor a younger brother... And you feel bad about that?
I think Sengoku said that simply because he wanted to be treated as a man, though.
Just doting on someone isn&#39;t enough to satisfy that.
It’s a difficult problem, isn’t it? We have our respective positions, but we’re human beings with flesh and blood. We aren’t mature enough to be capable of completely separating work and private life.
A novice like me shouldn’t say something haughty, but... We are humans, Anzu-dono. You will inevitably make mistakes, over and over again.
However, in this modern age, it isn’t such a suffocating era that even a single mistake cannot be forgiven until after one’s death...
It’s alright to make mistakes many times over, and to regret them just as much. After all, the most important thing is not to repeat them again, correct?
In hopes that next time nobody will get hurt — That hopefully, you can come closer to crafting a better future…
You have no choice but to put in the effort, reflect on yourself, and fumble your way forward. Fortunately, in this modern age... For kids like us, there is a “next time” waiting for us.
We were born in a happy era, not in the harsh Sengoku period — a period where, even if you stole nothing but a handful of rice, your hands would be cut off, or you would be killed...
As long as we’re allowed to make mistakes, and until the moment we use up all of my &quot;next times&quot;... there is nothing we can do but to make every effort we can until we become adults.
Carrying sins, mistakes, and scars, we have no choice but to grow so that we won&#39;t repeat them again.
Mm? Ahh, I’m simply echoing Hasumi-dono&#39;s words. He told me something like that when we first met...
There was something about it that really touched me, and that is why I&#39;m still by his side to this day.
That person has made mistakes and failed many times, but he still does all he can to keep moving forward. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same for Kiryu-dono.
That’s exactly why I want to serve and honor my seniors.
… Sorry, I wanted to listen to your worries, Anzu-dono, but I only ended up talking about myself.
But, well, understanding us “aidoru” to a deep level is never a waste for a “prodyusaa”.
Anzu-dono. I want you to smile. Everyone will worry if you look so gloomy. Plenty of our “kurasumeito” are nosey.
Let’s go back to where everyone is. If you feel anxious, I will protect you. You have an attendant by your side.
To be frank… Out of AKATSUKI and RYUSEITAI, I’m the only second-year.
If Anzu-dono weren’t here with me, I’d constantly have to grapple with being stuck between my juniors and seniors. Ha ha ha~♪

Scroll of the Elements Prologue

    Season: Autumn


    Location: Hallways


O~i, Kanzaki-dono! Kanzaki-dono~☆1 
Mm? Oh, Sengoku. You&#39;re full of energy as always. However, though it’s said that children will run even on a windy day, you shouldn’t run in the hallway.2

Hm? I&#39;m not a child, am I? I’m already a high school student~

Fufu, in the eyes of the world, high school students are still considered children. And whether you are an adult or a child, you must refrain from actions that cause trouble to others.
Hasumi-dono always scolds me for that, too.

Look. The papers I was carrying were swept away by the wind, thanks to you rushing in.

Ah, pardon me! Here, I&#39;ll pick them up~♪

Mm. I’m grateful… That aside, did you need something from me?

Huh? Ah, no, I didn’t have anything in particular! It’s just that when I saw you, Kanzaki-dono, I got so happy that I ran up to you~

What, are you a puppy? However, I&#39;m happy that you’ve become attached to me, as I don’t have much of a relationship with the underclassmen.

Kanzaki-dono, it’s hard to approach you because you always walk around with a sword hanging at your side. You’re also a member of AKATSUKI, the student council’s headlining unit…
It’s absolutely because of things like that that everyone perceives you as an intimidating person.

Are you also scared of me, Sengoku…?

Not at all! I used to think you were a menacing person, but when I talked to you, I realized you were really kind!3

Ah, but is it going to be too annoying if I get too friendly?!

That won’t happen. Let’s continue to get along… Sengoku ♪
At any rate, Sengoku, are you free right now? Hasumi-dono asked me to put up these “posutaa” on the bulletin board.
However, I’m having a difficult time with the amount. I’d appreciate your help.

That’s an easy task~! RYUSEITAI has just finished a big job4 and is currently on a break, so I have plenty of free time!
Surprisingly, our unit’s Taichou-dono5 gives us plenty of good rest~♪

It is the same for me. We are both blessed with good masters, aren’t we?
AKATSUKI is also on break.

The “Harouin Paatii” S1 will be held soon, you see. Hasumi-dono, or rather the student council, has been extremely busy preparing for it.
It&#39;s not to the point where he’s immobile, but it would be troubling if he were to push himself and deteriorate his health.
Therefore, I&#39;m helping out with student council errands in hopes of getting Hasumi-dono the freedom to move a little.

The current bustling of the student council is Hasumi-dono’s own personal matters, so…
Kiryu-dono and I have been told that we can take on individual work in the meantime, or unit work as only the two of us.
However, I feel that in doing so, we’d march on ahead without him. It makes me feel shameful. Could it be because I lack independence?

Ah, I also have a lot of free time when RYUSEITAI isn’t active. We’re similar after all~♪

Is that right? Well, ninjas and warriors might be similar in the eyes of the public, I suppose, but....

…Hm? Forgive me, Anzu-dono. I was about to kick you. Why are you kneeling here?
Are you feeling unwell? Are you okay? Should I take you to the infirmary?

You don&#39;t look like you&#39;ve slept much, Producer-dono. I&#39;m worried that you might be overworked!
If you give us your order, we who serve our “lord”6 will take care of all your troubles☆

Hya!? Eh!? “Don&#39;t refer to me as &quot;lord&quot; too much”...? I’d have understood it if you just said it~ I don&#39;t like you pinching my cheeks!

Now, now, Anzu-dono. Don&#39;t bully Sengoku too much, Buddha is watching.
Hm. Anzu-dono has been asked to do various projects, but has hit a wall...
You came to see the “posutaa&#39;&#39; on the bulletin board in case they had anything useful to reference?

Certainly, there are often “B1” notices, announcements and recruitment listings posted on this particular bulletin board.
There are so many that it would be futile to try peeling them all off, and they would just be put back up again. Even Hasumi-dono is overlooking it at this point.

Actually, the other day, we AKATSUKI participated in the “B1” Quarrel Festival...
We’re not in a position where we can openly regulate “B1”s anymore.
If we were to criticize someone for participating, and they were to criticize us for having done the same, we wouldn’t be able to refute it.
But a lively atmosphere is a good thing, so I suppose it&#39;s a mixed blessing.

…Huh? What&#39;s wrong, Anzu-dono? Do I have something on my face?
Hmm, “Are you interested in period dramas”...? Does it seem like I am?

It does, Kanzaki-dono. Moreso, you come off as the kind of cringey guy who likes period dramas and samurai so much that he wears a sword just for the sake of it.

Is that right…? Then let me explain just in case, but I have government authorization to wear a sword!7 Look, look, my license♪

The government? Who exactly are you, Kanzaki-dono…?

Anyway, what were you saying about period dramas, Producer-dono?
I like them and watch them often~!
In period dramas, ninjas are usually minor roles or one-off fighters, so I end up a little dissatisfied with their portrayal.

Eh? If there was a period drama that featured ninjas in the spotlight, would I want to appear in it?

I-Is there a proposal out there that looks like it was prepared just for me!?
If that&#39;s the case, I definitely want to appear! I won&#39;t let anyone else have it because it&#39;s my dream!
Fwoohh, my time has come at last~! ☆

Chapter 1

    Location: Tourist Village


Oi~ Anzu-dono! Anzu-dono~☆
It&#39;s finally the day of Scroll of the Elements! I got too excited again and woke up too early!
You arrived early too, huh? I’m always really impressed with how early you come to work ♪

H-Huh? No reply! I guess she can&#39;t hear me, but I don&#39;t want to be ignored…
Anzu-dono~! “Lord”~ I am over here~!

Ah, you finally noticed me. Ehehe, good morning～♪
Yes! Look, look here at this sculpture of Frog-san!
The sign said you could climb on and take photos, so I decided to go for a ride～♪
Please spare me from any scolding about how it’s embarrassing that I’m doing this as a high schooler, okay? This was a dream of mine, so please take a photo♪
Peace ☆ Don’t I look like Jiraiya?1 Ninpou, Toad no Jutsu~♪
Anzu-dono, I’d like you to play Orochimaru or Tsunade! — Eh, don&#39;t you know about the three-way stalemate?2 Orochimaru has the snake and Tsunade has the slug~♪
Huh? &quot;Be careful not to lose your balance and fall into the pond?&quot;

Don&#39;t look down on me, I&#39;m a ninja! Our main selling point is our agility...♪

However, just in case... It would be bad if I got injured, or got wet and caught a cold before Scroll of the Elements.
I will disembark from the statue. Farewell, Frog-san~♪
Hup–! Once again, good morning! Anzu-dono, thank you for your hard work~♪
Hm? What’s wrong? Why are you moving so strangely? Ooh, wait, are you hand-signing a jutsu?3

What? “Let me hug you...?” W-Why? Have you caught on to Taichou-dono’s hugging habit, Anzu-dono?
G-Gh–!? Hey, don&#39;t forcibly hug me! It hurts!

Hmm. Anzu-dono, your parents and younger brother will be away this weekend, so you’re feeling lonely, huh...
You’ve been busy with work lately, so you don’t have much contact with your family...?
I’m sorry to hear that…

Anzu-dono is a producer, so you must be much busier than me.
And although spending time with family is important, you can&#39;t neglect your work... I can guess that’s frustrating for you.
I understand; for me, in the past… until I entered Yumenosaki Academy, I pretty much stayed home all the time.
Lately, I&#39;ve been going outdoors more often, which makes my family lonely.

So every time I go home,  my parents come running towards me, saying “Shinobu~! Shinobu~!” ♪

Since I was a child, I’ve always been the odd-one-out who loved ninjas...
I’d always act and talk like a ninja, too. It worried my parents, as I didn&#39;t have any friends for a long time either.

I know they can&#39;t help but be overprotective, but it’s frustrating being treated as a child who can&#39;t do anything.
I’m already a teenager by now.
Anzu-dono. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re kind to me, but I&#39;m not a stuffed animal.
And I’m not your little brother either, you know…?


Ohh, that’s Sengoku’s voice! I see that Anzu’s here too! The two of you are here so early! Wonderful, I can tell you’re both motivated☆
I also arrived early, and have been making the rounds to greet people while checking the souvenir shops!
I&#39;m sure you know this, but this tourist spot is also the holy land for tokusatsu...☆4
You see, I spotted a Shocker Combatman over there just a minute ago! I got his autograph! Ahh, I&#39;m so happy!
My dream has come true~ This will become a family heirloom! Fuhahaha…☆

………

………

…— Sorry! My timing is always, always awful—!

Anzu and Sengoku, embracing each other like that… S- So it’s that kind of relationship, huh? I’m sorry, I don’t want to disturb you! I’ll take my leave!

N-No? Taichou-dono, you’re misunderstanding the situation—!

It’s alright. I understand.
To me, I believe that an idol and a producer together is a thorny road, and as captain, I don’t think I should overlook this love affair, but—!
No one can ever stop love!

I give you my blessings! That’s all I can say! I’m rooting for you! Goodbye!

I told you already, you have it wrong, Taichou-dono?! Don’t run off with the wrong idea in your head—! Every once in a while, I’d like you to listen to what people have to say!

Chapter 2

………

…………
………

(T-This is so awkward…! Why am I the first one from RYUSEITAI to get here? Aren’t Sengoku-kun and Morisawa-senpai always the ones to get here first…?)
(I thought I’d get lost wandering around an unfamiliar place, so I got here early, but…)
(It&#39;s just the two of us here — Me, and the scary vice president from AKATSUKI…)

(Ahh, I&#39;m so depressed, I want to die... I feel like my own lack of communication skills are to blame...)
(I can’t just run off somewhere… But I don&#39;t know what to say to someone I don&#39;t know well, either...)

(S-Someone hurry up and get here...! It’s getting hard to breathe...!)

You. Are you alright? Your complexion doesn’t look good. Are you feeling unwell?

Fweh…? Oh, me…? I’m fine, er, probably…?

Probably? Good grief. If you get anxious now, you&#39;ll only wear yourself out. Although, it&#39;s not good to be too relaxed, either.
...I think the others will be arriving soon, so just wait a little longer.

Ah, sure… I’m sorry…?

Why are you apologizing? We may be upperclassmen and underclassmen, but we’re about the same age in the end, and we’re performing a joint live together, so...
I’m not saying you should act overly familiar with me, but you don’t have to feel sorry like that..

Ah, okay… I’m so sorry…

I just said you don’t need to apologize, though… You. Let me see that bag for a bit.

Fweh…? Eh? What do you mean…? I-Is it a violation of the school rules in some way?

No. Show me the plush hanging off of it. This is Hanzoumon, isn’t it?

Ah, yeah… While I was on the way to our meeting spot, I saw it was on sale, so I bought it without thinking. Our eyes kinda met, y’know…♪

Is that so? Sorry, but let me have a good look.
Right now, I’m putting together different key points that I couldn’t fit in the pamphlet.
I’m thinking of making flyers of that information, and handing copies of it out for free, but...
Rather than just listing it out, I figured it would be easier to read it in manga form where Hanzoumon explains the information.

Considering that a lot of families with children come to this tourist spot.
But, I only have a faint recollection of its design, so I’d like to draw it while looking at the real thing.

Ahh, I was wondering what you were drawing a moment ago... Er, I&#39;ll put the Hanzomon plush here, if that’s fine...?

That’s helpful. Thank you.

………

What? Why are you staring? I assure you, I’ve been given permission to use Hanzoumon’s design. Once I finish the flyer, I’ll check again.

No, it’s just… You’re really good at drawing, aren’t you…?

It’s the work of an amateur5. I don’t have any art supplies right now, so I have no choice but to draw in an app on my tablet. I’m not accustomed to it, so the lines are shaky…
Ghh… if only I’d practiced a little more on digital…

It’s kinda unexpected. I always thought Vice President-san was a serious honor student…

There is no law that says honor students can’t draw. You. It seems like you like yuru-characters, hm?
How about I draw something for you? I’d like a good warm-up to get my fingers used to digital art.

Ah, then… Hikonyan…♪

That Akazonae character?6 I only have a faint memory of that one too… Isn’t it the one that looks like mochi?

Ah— I have a key strap…
My parents travel all around the country to buy vegetables, so I always ask them to buy me a yuru-character souvenir from wherever they go~♪

Midori-ku~n! Mornin’! ☆

Woah—! Y-You startled me. Morning, Tetora-kun…?

Yo! You looked like you were having fun talking about somethin’. Did I interrupt you guys?

No, no… It’s a relief you came, Tetora-kun. I don’t know how to talk to someone older than me…

Really? Aren’t you always bantering with Taichou? You aren’t together today?
At times like this, I feel like Taichou always goes to pick you up or somethin’, Midori-kun ♪

No… Morisawa-senpai has been somehow getting closer and closer with my parents…
I felt like it’ll get out of hand if it continues any further, so I’ve been telling him lately, “Don’t come to my house”...
I don’t want that guy to disturb even the peace of my own home…

Chapter 3

Ahaha, it&#39;s a luxury to get to worry about that kind of thing, Midori-kun. Personally, even if I ask Taishou, he doesn’t come to my house, so I‘m the one who goes to his, even if he never asked.
We came together today, too~♪

Don’t come to my place too much, Tetsu... My neighborhood isn’t that safe.
We do wanna move, though… I worry about my sister too, so I drop her off every morning and pick her up later.

Good morning, Kiryu. It feels like it&#39;s been a while. Are you in top shape?

Who do you think you’re talking to? C’mon, that’s my line…
I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine since it’s you, but if you end up lookin’ pathetic, I&#39;ll knock you off stage.

Heh. Rest assured, today I’m—... no. AKATSUKI is in top shape as always.
However, that Kanzaki… even though I went to the trouble of appointing him as the representative of AKATSUKI...
In the end, Kiryu and I got paired to play the lead roles for the AKATSUKI side of the performance, so I did encounter some difficulties.
In fact, the two of us had a lot more stage blocking than usual, so I had trouble learning the routine.
At this rate, it seems like there was no point in leaving everything to Kanzaki.
I was hoping that he would take on becoming the center of AKATSUKI, but...
Kanzaki is pretty subservient, it seems. If anything, he tries to bolster us up so much that it puts himself down in the process. It’s troubling.
Even though he&#39;s a kid who can do it if he tries…

Haha. That just means he holds us in high regard and treats us with respect. Isn’t that a blessing? Well, that also means we can’t ever perform poorly.

That’s true… Anyhow, so Kanzaki still hasn’t shown his face yet?
He&#39;s very precise with his time, and always arrives at the scene before anyone else, but…
I don’t see him anywhere. I’m worried… Did any of you see him on your way here?

No, I haven’t. I did pass by Taichou, Sengoku-kun and Anzu-anego, though.
When I called out to them, they said they’d meet up with us later, so I&#39;m sure they’ll show up soon.

What about Shinkai-senpai…? That guy’s pretty loose with time, so I&#39;m worried that he might be late...?
If anything, I think he’s the one that needs escorting from Morisawa-senpai…
Those two seem to be close friends, but… there’s something about that that they’re distant about. Like, doesn’t it feel like they’ve drawn a certain line between each other…?

Maybe it’s ‘cause there’s a different sense of distance when it comes to someone your age, and someone who’s your junior?
Same for you Midori-kun, wouldn&#39;t it be uncomfortable if I picked you up every morning? Like, “we’re peers, so don&#39;t act like a guardian~”, or something?

Not really, I wouldn’t mind if it were you, Tetora-kun... Unlike Morisawa-senpai, you don&#39;t push my personal boundaries or anything...

Yeah, that’s my point exactly; that’s the different sense of distance you get from someone of the same age, yeah?

That&#39;s an interesting conversation, but it&#39;s time for all of us to start heading to the stage. Otherwise, our progress will be hindered.
We’ll try to contact Kanzaki, so you all, check on the status of the other RYUSEITAI members.

Ahh, roger that! Midori-kun, do you know Shinkai-senpai’s phone number?

Yeah, I know it… I picked out a cute smartphone for Shinkai-senpai&#39;s birthday...
I was the only one who forgot about his birthday and didn’t prepare a present for him in time, so I got it for him to make up for my mistake...7
Just a sec, I’ll give him a call…
… Ah. Hello…? Shinkai-senpai…?

ye~s, hellooo~♪
— Huh? That voice is surprisingly close?!

Oi. In that river over there… isn’t that Shinkai?

puka, puka…~♪

Uwaa— What are you doing, Shinkai-senpai?! We’re not at school right now, so please don’t do anything so weird~!
They’ll call the police on you!


ahaha. my, my, [tetora]... you say the kinds of things [chiaki] does, don&#39;t you?

I think that&#39;s a completely proper comment to make.
Shinkai, if you misbehave, you’ll only give trouble to your unit, even your juniors. Get a hold of yourself, you’re incorrigible.

aren’t you bossy~ When my skin gets [dry], it gets suffocating for me.
also, [frog-san] was here, so I thought I’d give Shinobu a [present]~♪
that kid loves [froggies], so… hop, hop…~♪
when it was my birthday, everyone [celebrated] with me, yes? I want to [return the favor].
and so, i’m [fully motivated] for scroll of the elements, as well...～♪

Hmph. Good to know, then. — Wait, no, it’s not. Get out of the river at once. It may still be early in the morning, but more tourists are arrriving…
Don&#39;t expose the school&#39;s shame to the public too much, “Three Eccentrics”.

i won’t listen to the [things you say]. never again…8
but i [didn’t mean] to cause [trouble] for the [children] of [ryuseitai].
so, well... just this time, i’ll do [as you say] ♪

That’ll save us trouble. Does anyone have a towel or something to wipe Shinkai off?

Ah, I’ll do it! It&#39;s already autumn, Shinkai-senpai! You&#39;re gonna catch a cold~!

hehe, i’m not that [fragile], you know~♪
But, well, it’s a [good thing] to have someone be [worried] for you, yes?
i feel kind of [warm], so i&#39;m sure i won&#39;t catch a [cold]...♪

Chapter 1

    Location: AV Room


Mhmhm… I see! I understand perfectly!
In short…— you want to discuss Carranger, Sengoku! – No! Is it Ninjar?
Or Sekai Ninja Sen Jiraiya– Wait, I got it! Maybe Henshin Ninja Arashi…!?
No– is it possibly Science Ninja Team Gachaman…? Which is it? Which one do you want to talk about Sengoku?!

Sengoku, what language has this person been speaking in?

It’s probably Japanese, but you don’t need to pay attention to what Taichou-dono’s saying right now.
Frankly speaking, he’s saying things that don’t make a lot of sense.

nn~ it’s noisy, isn’t it…~?

Oh–! Buchou-dono!1 I see that you’re in a good mood as always~♪

actually, i’m not~ today was supposed to be a [day off]2, but we were [called in] anyway~ i’m annoyed~

Now, now, don’t say that!
Let us rejoice together, Kanata! That shy Sengoku raised his voice and said “I want to participate in this project!” all by himself!
Ahh, I’m so happy…! Today will become a day to remember for RYUSEITAI…☆

No, umm, Taichou-dono… Wasn’t I a little too assertive by asking that…?
Ninjas are my own personal interest, after all.
I feel a little sorry to make everyone in RYUSEITAI go along with it.

you’re so reserved, shinobu ~ It’s one for all~♪

And all for one! That’s RYUSEITAI! Fwahahaha!☆
If anything, everyone usually goes along with my principles, so...
I’ve been wanting to prioritize what everyone else wants to do every once in a while.

it’s not as if we’re being forced to [go along with you], chiaki~ because for me, i am doing what [i want to do].

Ahaha. When you say it like that, it saves me some face, but…
Takamine, Nagumo — Follow Sengoku’s example. If there’s something you want to do, say it without any hesitation! I will always welcome it! ♪

Something I want to do… Okay then, can I go home already…? ♪

I knew you’d say that! I just knew you’d say that!
Midori-kun, weren’t you complainin’ that you’re bored ‘cause there’s no RYUSEITAI activities?
If you’re gonna sit at home with too much time on your hands, then you might as well face some difficulties!

Speaking of which, I wanna do something like Taishou did the other day in the Quarrel Festival!
It was so manly and sparks were flyin’ everywhere from the clash! I was so jealous~♪

Yeah. We weren’t really able to participate in the Quarrel Festival beyond livening up the crowd… It might be a good idea to do it properly.
I’ll take note of that opinion.

[quarrel festival] was violent. i [didn’t like] it…~ fighting is [no good]. can’t we get along instead?

Heh. Sometimes exchanging fists is also part of friendship, Buchou-dono. A true blade is forged by striking it over and over again until sparks fly…♪

speaking as if you understand… well, [what happens next] matters more than [what has already happened]~
shinobu, what sort of [dreamfes] do you want to [participate] in?

Errr, well… Anzu-dono has prepared copies of the proposal and announcement posters for everyone, so I’ll hand them out ♪

I’ll help you, Sengoku-kun~ Anzu-Anego, thank you for your hard work ♪

Hmm… Is this request coming from outside the school? An unveiling ceremony for a new attraction at a tourist spot…
“If possible, we would like multiple popular units to appear.”

So since it’s a unit-based job, Sengoku couldn’t do it on his own, and he came to consult me...
Achieving this goal with this budget seems like a challenge, though.

Aaah… so it really is impossible…? Anzu-dono was also really worried about what to do, given that it’s such an unreasonable request on her~

Heh. Never fear, Sengoku– An ally of justice makes the impossible possible!

Um, AKATSUKI’s… Kanzaki-kun, right? Could I have a moment with you?

Mm? Me? That’s fine, say whatever you want.

Yes. Would it be possible to wedge AKATSUKI into this project?
If Hasumi were to have a hand in this, I know he could make even an impossible plan come to fruition.
If the student council were to authorize it as an official DreamFes, we’d be able to get additional funding. That’s a feasible way we could make it happen.
Your presence here is somewhat like fate. I’d be glad if we could have your cooperation.

I see… I too want to make Sengoku’s dream come true. I’ll try and put in a good word for him.
Hasumi-dono is a little busy right now, so I don’t want to burden him too much.
But Hasumi-dono is a person deeply filled with compassion and virtue. Even if he can’t fully get involved, I&#39;m confident he will offer some insight.
I will rush to the student council room to speak with him at once–!

Wait. We might as well go together since Hasumi and I get along too. Anzu, please come with us as well. You’re in charge of this project, aren’t you?
And Sengoku, you too. You’re the one with the most enthusiasm for this project. If you’re with us, it’ll be easier to persuade Hasumi.

Indeed. After all, Hasumi-dono is an empathetic soul! I see you understand him very well ♪

We’re classmates, after all. As for everyone else, I know it was a lot of trouble to come in and I’m sorry for that, but… it&#39;s okay to call it a day and disband for now.
I’ll keep you updated if there’s any progress.

No way, I’m coming with you too! It might be a nuisance if too many people crowd the room, but since I’ve got no club activities today, I have some free time.
– …C’mon, Midori-kun, don’t just go home, ‘kay~?

Ehh…? Didn’t he just say “disband”…?

now now…let’s all go [together], midori…~
the five of us together make [ryuseitai]. as long as everyone is there, any [miracle] can be performed ♪

Chapter 2

    Location: Student Council Room


Hm… I see. I get the gist of it.

Eh? You could understand the situation with such little explanation? As expected of Hasumi-dono~♪

Don’t be too liberal with flattery, Kanzaki. It’ll make you look cheap.
At any rate, day after day…
Like Prince Shotoku3, I work on multiple proposals at the same time, making adjustments while listening to a variety of opinions.
This much I can do with ease.
Morisawa had a clear grasp of the proposal’s outline and its main purpose. Even a monkey would understand it if it heard from this guy and filled in the gaps on its own.

Fwahaha! I don’t really follow, but I can tell you’re praising me! Thank you, Hasumi…☆

I’m not praising you. It’s just a simple fact. Nevertheless, don’t make too much noise in the student council room.
It’s partly my fault, but these days the student council seems to be looked down upon.
Just thinking of people perceiving us as a group of idiots makes me angry, so we have to buckle down. We have to maintain order in a disciplined, serious fashion.
We’ll just lose face if we take initiative and make a ridiculous scene.

The way you word things is a little tricky, Hasumi… To put it simply, what do you mean by that?
This project is about ninjas rampaging through a castle.
It could turn up looking something like foolish horseplay. Given AKATSUKI’s focus on strict, traditional performance, do you think it’ll even be possible for the concept to fit in with AKATSUKI’s image?

If possible, I’d like to do something like a joint live performance between RYUSEITAI and AKATSUKI, but...
I can&#39;t force you. If you guys say no, then that&#39;s that.

Did you forget that the other day, we were the protagonists of the raucous commotion of historic proportion called the Quarrel Festival?
Tradition is not just about adhering to the formal and strict relics of ancient times.
Ukiyo-e, now highly regarded around the world, was originally considered to have as much artistic value as tissue paper.
It became an art from the changes of the period and the efforts of our predecessors.

In a former age, TV, games, and even idols were ridiculed and looked down upon as tacky.
But now their statuses have risen, and they’ve all become major industries.
Now, in our modern day, even the things that are looked down upon as vulgar or commonplace... With time and effort, they become art.
For future generations, it may even be appreciated as part of traditional culture.

Ninjas… Aren’t they splendid? Since it has an air of Japanese style, we can incorporate it within the context of AKATSUKI.
It will strengthen the approachability that we lack.
Of course, it won’t be easy… but if done well, I think it would be a mutually beneficial proposal.

I’ll formalize some official paperwork, approve it as a DreamFes, and formulate a budget.
I’ll have to adjust my schedule as well… and contact Kiryu…

He gets into some surprisingly bad behavior when he has free time on his hands.

U-Um—!

Hm? What’s the matter… Sengoku, is it? Is there something you want to say?

No, um… So, you like ninjas? That’s unexpected~♪

There is no boy out there who doesn&#39;t like ninjas or dinosaurs.
I heard that you&#39;re hosting a Ninja Association of some kind. You are the lord of one country and one castle. Since you manage it without the help of anyone else, be more resolute.
Isara’s been worried, so even though club activities are just a hobby, you should give it all your might.

Ah, yes! This time at least, I’ll do my best to move everything forward~♪

Yes, keep at it. The same goes for this project — If we say it was done with the full cooperation of the Ninja Association, it’ll be a part of its records.
Since I’ll be drafting documents along those lines already, I’d like you to prepare necessary materials.
We’re already halfway into this school term, so I suppose you can’t expect any new members, but...
You&#39;re a first-year student. If you create a track record now, you’ll have that next year and circumstances will change.

It&#39;s an investment into the future. Depending on the results, it could serve as a good promotion for your club activities. So, well, make sure to work hard.

I understand! Uwaaa, I&#39;m so happy! You&#39;re thinking about me properly~♪

Hmph... Since this is your own project, lead it, and consult with Morisawa throughout.
Kanzaki, as AKATSUKI’s representative, you will cooperate with RYUSEITAI and ensure things go smoothly.
As you know, I&#39;m fairly busy. As we speak, my overall progress is slowing down.
I want to leave things to you when I can.
I&#39;ll practice properly and make sure it&#39;s perfect by the time of the actual performance, but I don&#39;t want any extra work in the meantime.

Kanzaki… You can’t rely upon me and Kiryu forever.
Sometimes it&#39;s good to be the man in front. This time, the fate of AKATSUKI is entrusted to you.

Don&#39;t get too reckless, or it’ll just cause trouble for everyone. Try your absolute best, you can do it.

M– Mm! I will do my best!
Oh, my blood is searing! Cheer for me, Sengoku! I have been entrusted with a role I’ve never had before!
Please tell me anything, I will fully cooperate as the leader of AKATSUKI! ♪

Yeah! If it’s Kanzaki-dono, it’ll be like I have the power of a hundred people helping me~♪

You two are good friends, huh... Well, that&#39;s all for now. Start moving quickly. Before you know it, time will pass and it’ll be the day of the actual performance.
I&#39;ll take care of my work as soon as possible and join you when it’s done.

Mm! It&#39;s time to conquer, and the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step! Kanzaki Souma, pushing onward...☆

(Heheh. He&#39;s so excited, that Kanzaki).
(Up to this point, Kiryu and I have done everything in AKATSUKI. It’s not his fault, but… unfortunately, in all that time, that guy never really had to bear the brunt of anything).
(We won&#39;t be here next year, so Kanzaki must study hard so that he can stand on his own when the time comes).

(Ah, I can&#39;t help but tear up... I wonder if this is what it&#39;s like when your children become independent).
(I feel lonely, but I&#39;m proud. Do your best, Kanzaki, I&#39;ll always be on your side).

Chapter 3

    Location: Garden Terrace


Alright. For the most part, it’s coming together.
The name of the DreamFes is “Scroll of the Elements”, and it’ll be a joint live performance between RYUSEITAI and AKATSUKI.
The theme is “ninjas”. It seems they want to do a tie-in with a movie if possible.

Due to copyright issues, we can’t really use movie lines verbatim, but...
Well, design-wise, we should keep to the theme as best we can.
The performance doesn’t need to be a musical-esque narrative either.
Regardless, I&#39;m sure fans of the movie will come to see it, so I&#39;d like to take the initiative to incorporate its trademark lines.

The DreamFes venue is a tourist spot that recreates the world of period dramas. It gets used for movie shootings, too.
Additionally, the sponsor will be the event organizers at the site.
The organizers have the personnel and know-how to manage stage production, so we can just give our input and leave it to them. Hasumi and I will handle the negotiations.

The purpose of the live show is to attract tourists to the venue and promote newly opened attractions and facilities.
Admission will be free. It seems that the profit will come from limited-edition merchandise.
I’ll leave the preparation of goods and the like to Anzu. It’s her specialty, and she seems to have connections.

I’ll also ask Anzu to handle discussions about the goods. If you have any trouble, Anzu, Hasumi and I are willing to help you.
I want you all to tell her your opinions about the kinds of merchandise that would work.

When it comes to merchandise, how about yuru-characters…?4 ♪
Anzu-san, what kind of mascot characters does the tourist spot have…? Every tourist spot has one these days…

Ah… A cute ninja called “Hanzoumon”...? As in, Hanzou-mon?
It’s like a vague combination of the names of the famous ninja Hattori Hanzou5 and the famous yuru-chara Kumamon, huh…? ♪

Ah, Takamine, sorry. Your captain is talking right now, so please be quiet.

Ehh...? Even though you never listen whenever I tell you to shut up...?

Ahaha... Anyway, most guests at tourist destinations aren’t usually interested in idols.
Of course, our fans will come to see us, but for the most part, the audience will be the general public.
There will be a lot of older people who don&#39;t know about the unspoken etiquette of idol concerts, so...
We’ll have to be careful about how we present ourselves. Be mindful of your words and actions and be considerate. Give thorough explanations.

If things go well, we&#39;ll be able to attract new fans out of the people who don&#39;t normally have anything to do with us. Good luck, everyone. Hip, hip, hooray! ♪

Hip, hip, hooray! ♪ I&#39;ll check with Hasumi-dono, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any problem with AKATSUKI going in that direction.
Now that the outline has been decided, I would like to work out the specific content of the “raibu”6.

Sounds good. Sengoku is the one who knows a lot about ninjas, so I&#39;ll leave it to him from here on out.
Ah~... I&#39;m a little worn out after such a lively discussion. I&#39;m parched.

I&#39;ve made some tea, so please help yourself. There are also teacakes I’ve made by hand.

souma, you’re getting [better and better] at cooking, aren’t you…~?

Cooking aside, I’ve practiced conducting tea ceremonies since I was a child. It&#39;s a samurai tradition...
Though, I don’t feel that it matches the Western-style atmosphere of “Gaaden Terasu”.

Chapter 4

Anyway, everyone, help yourselves to some refreshments.

Wow! Thank you so much~ I used my brain a lot today, so it’s craving sugar~♪

I am the same way. I should try to think for myself without leaving things to my seniors more often… However, they say that it&#39;s difficult to tell a poor thinker from a sleeping one.

ahaha. as a [senior], i would like you to try [thinking] for yourself a little more.
[leaving everything up to us] entirely is a lot of [responsibility], which is [frightening].

Yeah. I think so too.
But Kanzaki-kun is a second year student. He has solid opinions, a lot of experience, and he’s reliable. His input was pretty helpful.
Thanks to him, Scroll of the Elements is coming together surprisingly smoothly.

Haha, I feel somewhat bashful. Kiryu-dono is delayed in joining us, and Hasumi-dono can&#39;t take his hands off student council duties, so...
As the representative of AKATSUKI, I shouldn’t do anything embarrassing.

how admirable, souma. good boy, good boy…♪7

Huh? Buchou-dono is extremely kind today…! But he always treats me rather harshly, so it&#39;s actually kind of scary…?
No, but I understand that the usual is a matter of tough love!

ufufu. if you always acted [seriously], i wouldn’t be so [unkind] to you, either…~♪

Uuu... I always try to be serious, though…

That’s not fair~! Shinkai-dono, you’re being really nice to your club’s underclassman, huh~?
i am always [kind]~. [clubs] and [units] are different.
if i had the same [attitude] for both, it’d be [weird], wouldn’t it?

Nghhh, I want Taishou8 to pat my head and call me a good kid, too. Um, Kanzaki-senpai, Taishou seems like he’s busy… I wonder where he is right now; what’s he been doing…?

Haven&#39;t you heard? Lately, Kiryu-dono’s been participating in a multitude of “B1”&#39; tournaments out of the blue.
You see, one of his classmates has asked him to appear to help.9
Though this is our decompression period, he said that if he has nothing to do, he will inevitably get out of shape…
After all, that man is a warrior at heart.
Additionally, we, AKATSUKI, have always ruled as statesmen, and have only ever competed against weak opponents.
Therefore, it’s likely he wanted to dress up as a footsoldier and crawl through the mud to gauge the atmosphere of the front lines.
Otherwise, our perceptions will gradually deviate from reality.

If you settle for turning away from battle and hiding in basecamp, you will lose your survival instinct and miscalculate the real state of affairs.
That sort of thing is what he seems to think, anyway. I agree with Kiryu-dono, and I’m proud of him. The two of us are lucky to have a great senior♪

U~myu… If that&#39;s how it is, I wish he’d invited me too. Is it unmanly to think that way?

But Taishou’s way of life really is cool after all~♪
It’s been a while since Taishou’s gone around operating solo... Ahh, I’d love to see that valiant figure. Can I go watch his match for a li’l while?

After we finish having this discussion. You and Sengoku are both first years, so support him.
For having peers you can walk alongside with is something to be very thankful for.


  
  
  
  
  

Translation Notes
↑ Souma refers to Kanata as 部長 (buchou, lit. chief ), or club president (Kanata's position in their club).↑ Kanata's dialogue is completely in hiragana, likely to emphasize his slow, relaxed way of speaking. Some words are in brackets likely due to Japanese being difficult to read in full hiragana (it would be like reading English sentences without spaces between words).↑ An influential leader from the 6th-7th centuries, Prince Shotoku is credited with modernizing government administration. He is also considered foundational for the spread of Buddhism in Japan. Read more here.↑ From 緩い (loose, laid-back) + マスコットキャラクタ (mascot character), ゆるキャラ (yuruchara) are Japanese mascots.

Chapter 1

    Location: Tourist Village


Content Warning: Mentions of self-harm

… Alright. We cut it close, but the flyer is completed. All we have to do is send the data, check with the person in charge, and leave printing and distribution to staff.

I don’t really get it, but thanks for your hard work. Now we just have to wait for Kanzaki to arrive. I wonder what he’s doing…

I don’t know. It is extremely troubling being unable to contact him, so I’d wish he’d get into the habit of using his cellphone already...
He always has needlessly long items hanging off of him, and yet he doesn’t carry any digital devices.
Well, when I contacted his parents, it seems that he’d already left home a while ago, so… I think he’ll be able to make it in time for rehearsal.
Still, it feels like it’s getting a little too late. I’m worried. I hope he hasn’t gotten into an accident…

Calm down, danna0 He’s not a toddler taking his first steps or somethin’. You’d be lookin’ down on him, being so overprotective.
If something happened, he’d probably call you from a public phone or something or the other.
Leave that aside for now — Let’s do costume fitting, and go over the script again.
How does the costume feel? Is it difficult to move in? I’ll fix it up a bit if it is.

No problems at all. It’s so comfortable, I’d want to wear it everyday.
I’m impressed with how unique the script is without interfering too much with the content from the tie-in movie. It’s littered with interesting elements.

Yeah, the costumes, script and stage were all prepared by the staff.
Sure enough, you can learn a lot from professional work. Look at the beauty of these seams~♪

You’re in unusually good spirits, Kiryu.
… I heard that while I was busy, you’ve been charging into various “B1” matches like you were storming dojos1. But, well, it seems like it was a nice break for you.

I won’t do anything reckless, so don’t worry. I’m not gonna cause any trouble for AKATSUKI or the student council.
I’m in a position of authority now, so I can’t be a naughty kid.

I know. No, I trust you. I’m sorry for putting you in such an inconvenient position, Kiryu.

I’m not a brat, y’know, I agreed to it. I don’t think of myself as inconvenienced or tied down.
Adult freedom is freedom as long as it doesn’t hurt the public.
Instead of getting wasted and going on a tear at a coming-of-age ceremony... Having a glass of beer after a long bath at the end of a hard day&#39;s work is probably more precious.

… You don&#39;t drink alcohol, do you?

I’m drunk almost every day, even without the use of alcohol, y’know. ...Oh, it looks like that Kanzaki guy finally arrived after waiting forever, huh?

Eh, where? Mm… my eyesight might have gotten worse again.


Hasumi-donooooo! Kiryu-donooooo! I apologize for arriving late…!
Kanzaki Souma has arrived, please forgive my rudeness! To atone for being late, I will disembowel myself on the cross!2

A HOOORSE?!
K-... K-K… Kanzaki?! You—* *a-aah— even I can’t find the words for this—!

What’s wrong, Hasumi-dono! Calm down, please; we are at one’s palace!
Are you nervous before the big stage? So Hasumi-dono also has a novice side to him~♪

O-Oi, Kanzaki? Stop for a sec, don’t just rush in without pause?!

Ah—! Once more, please forgive me!
This horse and I were in such harmony3, I had forgotten that I was still riding! Ha-ha-ha☆

Kanzaki… For now, dismount that horse, and sit seiza4 there.

Huh? Hmm... I guess you&#39;re angry at me for being late, Hasumi-dono.
Your anger is understandable. I will slit open my stomach promptly, then. I will leave the beheading to you~♪5

Don&#39;t commit seppuku so easily. I’ve always wondered this about you, but from what era did you time-travel from?

Well, you see, hahaha... The hands on my family’s clock have stopped since the Edo period.

Have your parents been pestering you  or something? It seems your relatives aren&#39;t very fond of idol activities...
And so, they didn’t pay for transportation, giving you no choice but to take a horse?

Ah, no. After a long period of convincing, my father and mother are finally showing some understanding.
Hasumi-dono, Kiryu-dono, and Anzu-dono have all visited my home many times and spoke for me to them, after all.
They can feel your sincerity. Besides, my parents aren&#39;t that antiquated6. Some relatives still wear bitterness on their faces, though.
I was the one who knocked on the door of Yumenosaki Academy with the desire to become an “aidoru”.
No matter what anyone says, and no matter what hardships I may be given, my feelings will not change.
But if it&#39;s a nuisance for AKATSUKI and everyone else... I have no choice but to apologize.

When have I ever said you’re a nuisance? Well, it is a bit of a bother, but... If you’re a proper man, follow through on your original intention.
If you desire the world, then grasp it for yourself. Kiryu and I will always be on your side.

Ahaha, I don&#39;t want something so ambitious, but...
As a samurai warrior who attends Hasumi-dono and Kiryu-dono, I’m committed to not being a disgrace at the very least.
By the way, this horse is owned by our family. His name is Saigodon.
As far as I’m concerned, we’re like brothers who grew up running around the mountains and fields together.
Apparently they&#39;re going to use him for movie filming, so... my parents told me that if we were going to the same destination, I could ride him here.
And since I thought it would be faster than walking, I mounted him.
However, in the end, I wound up getting stuck in traffic and almost being late. Modern Japan is not very suitable for traveling by horse.

I&#39;ve always been telling you to choose a more modern mode of transportation.
Well, even if it can&#39;t be helped this time, from now on, you&#39;ll meet up with me or Kiryu first and then head to the site.

Mm, understood~♪

You’re only ever good at responses, aren&#39;t you...?

Chapter 2

Look, Saigodon. It’s my seniors, say hello~♪

Eeep, don&#39;t lick me! Can&#39;t you see, I&#39;m already dressed and have my makeup done!
You too, er… Saigodon? After you’ve safely delivered him, go get changed!

Hmm. There&#39;s no need to be so scared, Hasumi-dono.
Saigodon is an excellent horse trained in acting. He can purposefully fall down in ways that don’t hurt his rider.

I’m not really scared, but big creatures have a sense of intimidation that threatens our survival instincts.
I do also have trauma. When I was young, and I misbehaved, I would get locked in a room lined with giant Buddha statues.

Well, that’s odd. Aren’t you on good terms with the huge Kiryu-dono?

I can talk, can’t I? Danna’s eloquent, but he’ll have trouble speaking with things that don’t speak back.
There, there, there... He’s bein’ real obedient, huh? What a very clever horse~♪

Um, everyone~? It’s gotten noisy for some reason, but has Kanzaki-dono arrived?
If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d like to do a rehearsal of the performance shortly~?
— Is that a horse?! Wow, it really feels like I’ve traveled back in time to the Sengoku period~♪7

Hm, a scoundrel! I jest… Sengoku’s completely a ninja now~♪8

I&#39;ve been a ninja from the beginning, haven&#39;t I~? Hehe, this is a real ninja costume made by a professional who works on period dramas!
Well, it&#39;s a stage costume, so it&#39;s also flashy and colorful~♪

Are you not concerned about historical research or authenticity, Sengoku?

Well, if you wanted to be authentic, ninjas rarely wore “ninja outfits” to begin with.
Since they were intelligence operatives, it was normal for ninjas to blend in with the crowd by disguising themselves as townspeople or monks.
In order to adapt to modern times, there is a certain degree of symbolization... characterization that’s needed.
I admired ninjas not because of the way they looked, but because of their way of life~♪

Is that right? Sengoku is remarkable, he really has an eye for discerning the true nature of things...♪

…~♪

Huh? What is it, Hasumi-dono? Why are you looking at me so pleasantly?

Well, Kanzaki acting like a senior is rare, so it&#39;s just interesting...
Alright, stop the chatter and go change your clothes. We, AKATSUKI, cannot neglect our role of being the perfect example.

Kanzaki, I&#39;ll help you get dressed. I wanna do the finishing touches to your hair and makeup myself.

Mm, I’m grateful. Only with Kiryu-dono’s consideration are we complete as AKATSUKI.
But before that, I&#39;m going to deliver the Saigodon to the movie set, so please excuse me for a moment~♪

Kanzaki-dono~, I want to ride the horse, too~♪
Sengoku, sometimes you unexpectedly say things like a toddler. Alright, get on, get on.
It’ll be light enough if it’s only you. Don’t shout, or you’ll frighten Saigodon.

Understood! Wow, I’ve always dreamed of riding a horse~♪

Oi, wait a minute. Sengoku, your stage clothes will get dirty…

Gallop, gallop ♪ Hi-ho, Saigodon!

Haha, now it&#39;s not a period drama, but a Western one...♪

Ah, they’ve gone off, how incorrigible. Our juniors are a little too free-spirited.

Haha. As long as it&#39;s the kind of freedom that doesn’t cause trouble to others, it&#39;s fine. Us seniors can save strictness for when it’s needed.

……….

Whoa, you startled me. Morisawa, what’s wrong? Your complexion doesn’t look good?

Kiryu… Hasumi… What do you think love is?

Hah? Don&#39;t touch the koi9 in that river, they cost millions of yen.

Hasumi’s dumbassery aside, Morisawa, why are you sayin’ things straight out of a shoujo manga. Get it together, this is outta character for you.

Sorry, Taishou. Taichou’s been actin’ strange for a while now.
There was some kinda weird misunderstanding when he saw Sengoku-kun and Anzu-anego hugging each other.
As they said themselves, it&#39;s the same as when you hug Midori-kun and stuff, Taichou.
It’s just skinship.10 It’s not love or anything, right?

Mmngh… I know, but it was so shocking, even I’m surprised by my reaction…
Right, Anzu’s a girl… And we’re all healthy high school students…
Even if it were a millionth of a chance, there’s still a possibility it could happen. I didn&#39;t take that into consideration, even though being an ally of justice means preparing for all kinds of situations.
This time it was a misunderstanding, but someday it might not be a joke. I have to start thinking about what to do if that were to happen…
Ugh, but I&#39;m not good at topics like this!

ryusei cho~p~♪
Ryusei Ki~ck…♪

Ugya!? Wh-What are you two doing all of a sudden!? I&#39;m against violence...!

Hey, you can’t slack off when you’re the one who always acts big and tells me to concentrate…
And besides… you always try to solve everything yourself…
But nobody ever asked you to do that… How many times do I have to tell you not to carry the burden all by yourself...?

that&#39;s right~ [helping when nobody ever asked] may be the hero&#39;s [duty], but chiaki is no longer [alone], right?
i’m here, and so is everyone else. the five of us together are [ryuseitai].
please don&#39;t be conceited and think you&#39;re [fighting] all by yourself~♪

Chapter 1

    Location: Scroll of the Elements Stage


Right, gentlemen. Are you all ready? Well then, let&#39;s go~♪
An unprecedented gamble, where anything can happen— AKATSUKI and RYUSEITAI, a collaboration seen only in dreams! The curtain rises, and Scroll of the Elements is about to begin...!

“It&#39;s the Age of Warring States, the era of rival factions… A small, peaceful and quiet country lies nestled in the cool shade of a mountain pass. Here, seeing the world is beyond one’s wildest dreams. Here, a strange incident has occurred.”
“An impregnable mountain castle, protected by natural fortresses. Every day, the security guards sit cross-legged on its sturdy ground, careless with their duties. Taking advantage of those negligent security guards…”
“A suspicious shadow is trying to sneak in.”

(Ohh... As expected of Sengoku, you’re living up to the name of a Broadcasting Committee member. You speak quite fluently, with confidence.)
(Your tone is easy and clear to the ears… What a pleasant voice to listen to.)

(Heheh, I practiced a lot for this~♪)
(Excuse me, Kanzaki-dono... my turn is coming, so I&#39;ll hand over the narration to you.)
(Please make our first appearance as exciting as possible~♪)

(Understood. I am also used to this kind of role.)
“Come now, the main characters have made their entrance! Take a close look at today’s brave heroes!”

“One~! I want to be the one to stand out from the crowd!”

Two…~ To tell you the truth, I just wanna hide…”

“Three! We’re already going three different directions, huh~?”

“Four! I don’t really follow, but not a problem, for we are close friends~♪”

“Five! The five of us together are RYUSEITAI…☆”

“Oh, what could that be? Is it a bird? Is it an airplane? No, it’s a ninja!”
(Hmmm… It&#39;s the Sengoku period, so is it really alright to say something like &quot;airplane&quot;?)
(Although, there are also period dramas where they do peace signs, so…?)
(As long as the message gets across, then it’s fine. Noh and Kabuki use archaic words, so they aren’t able to convey even half of the fun for people without prior knowledge.)
(The traditional performing arts may be like that, but…)
(We are “aidoru”. AKATSUKI is a modern translation of a traditional art buried under the rubble of ancient times…)
(Conveying that charm, making it shine as my weapon… That&#39;s how I intend to spend this fleeting life.)
(Without throwing out the antiques, we will give them flesh and blood, inherit them, channel them! It&#39;s the same for sumo, kendo, traditional Japanese dance, tea ceremonies, and that of course means ninjas, as well!)
(Inheriting the culture from all kinds of traditional arts…!)
(We will become a bridge between the past and the future...!)

“Landing, hup~♪”
(Hehe. I&#39;ve grown used to stunts like this: like descending from a high place using rope work.)
(In terms of setting, it is as if I’m flying in the sky with a kite and landing on the castle tower~♪)
(Our mission is to invade the fortress and obtain the scroll that the lord of the castle is hiding in the tower.)
(It’s said that hidden there is evidence of the lord’s infidelity.)
(We ninjas were deployed at the request of the lord&#39;s wife.)
(A cheating investigation~? It’s spy-like, so that means it’s also ninja-like. Plus, it makes it easier to understand for modern people, as well.)
(After all, if they made the plot too serious, people would be turned off.)
(The aim is to draw people in first with a bright and fun slapstick drama and then have them watch until the end.)
(Scroll of the Elements can be viewed for free, so if you leave in the middle, your pockets won&#39;t be hurt...)
(However, it would be a bit of a shame if people went home.)
(The introduction, development, plot twist and conclusion. Slow, into an accelerando, and then the finale*.* Savor every bit of it! I would be happy if you could fall in love with ninjas, even just a little~♪)
(I was accepted, and my “love” was affirmed!)
(Even if it’s only by the kind members of Yumenosaki Academy’s RYUSEITAI so far!)
(One day, I will spread it to the whole world! Ninjas are a single miracle that shined in me —  someone who had spent a gloomy youth all the way until high school started!)
(“This is how it is as a ninja, for ninjas love solitude, love the dark, love frogs”...)
(That was my excuse to get by at first, yet I was saved regardless.)
(That is why I hope that someone who is living gloomy days like I once was will find the same salvation as I have!)
(That is my wish, my dream! I will deliver it with all my heart and soul!)
(After all, I love ninjas...☆ Until everyone shares that &quot;love&quot; with me, I can’t keep hiding in darkness!)
(Wearing colorful and flashy costumes, we will continue to sing and dance on stage~!)

Chapter 2

“♪～♪～♪”

(Ohh… Sengoku, you&#39;ve completely let go. You&#39;re always reserved, or rather, you tend to retreat behind everyone else…)
(Yet your eyes are sparkling right now. You really like ninjas, don&#39;t you? It&#39;s wonderful to have something you like.)
(If you have that “love”, then your life — this whole world will be even brighter.)
(That brilliance may make someone&#39;s dreams come true, like a shooting star.)
(It could become a ray of hope for someone walking down an alley at night with their head down…  It could even become a miracle of its own.)
(No. Let&#39;s form the trajectory for that miracle together.)
“♪～♪～♪”

(Senpai… Uh, I know you’re getting emotional right now, but aren’t you forgetting what you have to do…?)

(Ohh, sorry. It&#39;s a bad habit of mine. When I&#39;m happy, I get so excited that my mind goes blank. Thank you for warning me, Takamine~♪)

(I didn’t say anything particularly special… I usually blank out on stage, too, and I end up standing like a deer in headlights...)
(At times like that, everyone is always there to back me up, right...?)
(Even if it&#39;s just that much, I&#39;ll repay the favor... I have to clear up those debts properly, or else I&#39;ll feel uneasy...)

(Yeah, you&#39;re a good kid, Takamine~♪ That&#39;s wonderful, the good you do for others is good you do yourself...! All for one, and one for all!)

(Midori-kun, stand back for a sec. Taichou&#39;s gonna do some crazy stunt to blow a hole in the tower and break in.)
(It uses gunpowder, so if you&#39;re too close, you&#39;ll get hit too.)

(Mm, I know… Then the castle will catch fire, and we panic… Shinkai-senpai tries to extinguish the fire and creates a muddy stream...)
(And then we all get swept away by it, right…)
(The lyrics, production, and movements were all set so that the audience could understand what’s happening without needing an explanation...)
(It&#39;s pretty amazing, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s slapstick and funny...♪)
(If I could have, I would have loved to experience it as an audience member...♪)

(Ahaha, it&#39;s the customer&#39;s privilege to have fun. But there&#39;s no rule that says we can&#39;t have fun, right?)
(Guuhhh–! Every single time… The stage gets me psyched! I’m fired up~! ♪)
“♪～♪～♪”

“♪～♪～♪”

(Mhm. Sengoku is obviously more lively this time, but Nagumo and Takamine have grown significantly since the first time we’ve met, too.)
(For Nagumo, he lost his bad habit of rushing ahead.)
(And for Takamine, he is able to take in his surroundings well enough to give me a heads up. This is a great sign, it&#39;s absolutely wonderful.)
(It would be pathetic if I dragged everyone down here, so I&#39;ll show you how cool I am as your captain.)


“We have no other choice— let&#39;s blast it open! Ninpou: Blazing Escape Technique...☆”
(While making comical movements of panic to indicate that “Oh no! It’s causing a fire!”… The song and melody continues— is that right…?)
(I was given some acting guidance, so I wonder if I’m managing to perform everything naturally…?)
(It’s a pretty busy performance, with so much to do. But, well, period dramas are the distant ancestors of tokusatsu...)
(For the land that gave birth to the heroes I love, I hope I can help cultivate the soil again.)
(Times change and people change, but the voices of people who love justice and desire peace should be respected! Let&#39;s fight for that together, everyone~♪)
“♪～♪～♪”

“♪～♪～♪”
(wawa—... i can’t handle the heat... it&#39;s real [gunpowder], that’s for sure. it&#39;s dangerous.)
(i’ll become [grilled fish]~, i have to hurry and [extinguish] it.)


 "ninpou: water escape technique～♪” 

(ohh… the [water] is flowing in, my skin feels [moisturized]~♪)
(most of the [water] is for [show], but [fire extinguishing] foam is being [sprayed] everywhere at the same time...)
(and in the blink of an eye, the [fire] goes out.)
(i wonder what kind of [mechanism] they’re using… they did explain it, but it was [beyond my comprehension].)
(this is the [art] of [special effects], huh~ it&#39;s like [magic].)
([we] couldn&#39;t use [magic]. even though we were called something akin to [supernatural creatures]...)
(we had no [means] to resist the bitter [reality].)
(but, i am still alive. in this reality… i have found a [means] to survive — a [place to belong].)
(feeling happy for being accepted… it’s not just you, shinobu.)
(i was ostracized, and then driven [far away] from the [stars] in the night sky.)
(but, there was someone who went so far as to stretch his hand out to me.)
(i don’t [regret] grasping that [hand] tightly. sometimes it is so hot that it can be [uncomfortable], but….)
(i was in the cold, icy [sea] so… fortunately, it feels warm.)
(it fits just right, i’m [comfortable] like this.)
(puka, puka…♪)

Chapter 3

“♪～♪～♪”
(Alright. So far so good. Let’s start putting the finishing touches on it.)
(The samurai working in the castle who rush to engage the idiotic ninjas — That&#39;s our role as AKATSUKI.)
(The lord of the castle is taking excessive defensive measures to prevent the scroll – evidence of an affair – from being stolen.)
(Numerous traps and devices toss the RYUSEITAI ninjas about.)
(We also get caught up in the commotion and end up falling into a trap together, going every which way.)
“You’ll pay for this, you morons! I&#39;ll catch you and behead you~!”
(Laughter everywhere... In the meantime, a strange friendship begins to develop between the ninja and the samurai, and there are more scenes of them escaping from pitfalls together.)
(Rather than a true period drama, it should be seen as a skit based on that theme.)
(I&#39;m sure Eichi and Hibiki would be in hysterics if they saw it. I&#39;m glad this was a joint live with RYUSEITAI instead of fine.)
(Kyogen, monkey mawashi... Manzai, mandan, and rakugo are all traditional arts. Just because it&#39;s a comedy sketch doesn’t mean we’ll cut corners. We&#39;ll do our best to accomplish it.)
(If everything goes well, people’s impression of AKATSUKI will change drastically.)
(Since it&#39;s not a play, everything is expressed through song and dance... At minimum, it’s  supplemented with narration and such.)
(The script was written by a professional, and the audience is able to understand it without any confusion.)
(Our actions leave them on the edge of their seats, they sympathize, and they support us at times.)
(It’s a pleasant feeling... Live performances aren&#39;t a gamble where people win or lose. I feel like I’ve remembered that now.)
“♪～♪～♪”

“♪～♪～♪”

(Kiryu, I know you&#39;re having fun, but... Please keep the fun to that level.)
(You guys are the only ones whose actions are too showy. You&#39;re nearly eating up Kanzaki and Sengoku&#39;s stage presence.)

(Ah, that&#39;s right. The climax is gonna be a spotlight on those two, so we shouldn&#39;t get in the way.)
(Let&#39;s retreat for now, Tetsu.)

(Ossu! I’m overwhelmed with emotion that I got to join forces with Taishou~! ♪)

(Haha. Looks like you didn&#39;t neglect your training even while I was away.)
(You seem to imitate me all the time, so I wanted you to step away ‘n look at yourself again, Tetsu.)
(Do you really just wanna be me? No, right? Then find your own path as a man~♪)

(Ossu, I&#39;ll keep that in mind! So that&#39;s what Taishou had in mind all along...)
(I was real anxious that you started hating me or kept your distance from me ‘cause I was annoying you!)

(Sorry. I felt like over-pampering you wouldn’t be a good idea.)
(Don&#39;t become a copy of me... Absorb me and Morisawa’s good points— everyone&#39;s good points and become a great man.)

(I told you already, you can’t have your little tryst forever, wrap it up... It&#39;s your turn, Kanzaki, are you ready?)
(Timing is essential, make sure you make me say “splendid!” ♪)

(Mm, I&#39;ll do my best. But Hasumi-dono, is it okay for me to be in charge of the final scene?)
(I&#39;m confused because I was only informed about this last minute, and I&#39;m worried I haven&#39;t practiced enough...?)

(Give it a shot. Anything can happen if you try, and nothing will happen if you don&#39;t… That’s how it goes.)
(I don&#39;t mean to copy Kiryu’s words, but it won&#39;t work if I just spoil you. Man up, Kanzaki.)

(Mm, alright. I can&#39;t face the sun with pride if I only hesitate after having been encouraged so much. Leave it to me, Hasumi-dono—)
(I will never do anything that would betray your trust.)
(I will repay your kindness with service. That is my pride, the Japanese valor that I have inherited from my ancestors.)
(Even if some people laugh at my old-fashioned values, my seniors praise me.)
(To repay that kindness... Kanzaki Souma will pass through.)
(Sengoku, are you ready?)

(Yeah, Kanzaki-dono! It’s all OK, I’m ready to go any time~♪)

(It&#39;s a dangerous role, so are you sure you’ll be fine? It&#39;s better not to overdo it because life is at stake here, alright?)

(Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve practiced a lot! Leave it to me, nin-nin~♪)
(...Ninjutsu and ninpou training are of no use in this modern era.)
(I’ve spent half my life being constantly scolded by everyone, who told me to do something more constructive— something more realistic.)
(I had been told that, instead of spending all my pocket money on shuriken or something, I should invest in my future—)
(That it’s more meaningful to memorize math formulas, chemical symbols, and kanji than to memorize tons of ninja names—)
(And that&#39;s actually true. Everyone&#39;s opinions are proper and correct.)
(But… just because everyone is right doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m wrong.)
(Everyone is different, everyone is good. That is what my comrades RYUSEITAI told me — and alongside them, I will put together a performance for the sake of adding beauty to the stage.)
(Thinking about it, I’ve accumulated so much training thus far just for this moment.)
(That thought makes me feel rather satisfied and proud of myself.)
(No, in fact… To the me from when I hadn’t yet started speaking like a ninja would...)
(I want to tell the “me” from back then that nothing was ever in vain.)

(Is that so? In that case, I have nothing else to say here. Samurai and ninja are the same; anything you could say to a man with an expression like that is only wasted breath.)
(Let&#39;s at least treat each other with sincerity.)
(Now, like usual... Let&#39;s fulfill our duty, ninja of RYUSEITAI.)

(That’s just what I was hoping to hear from you, samurai of AKATSUKI~♪)
(We each hold our own forms of justice up high.)
(Kamen Rider and Super Sentai, Showa Rider and Heisei Rider... heroes of American comic book movies, too—)
(When all of them meet, they have conflicting opinions and clash. However, in the end, they join forces to fight a common enemy. That is the staple of these shows.)
(Even if the place of birth is different, even if the color of justice is different—)
(We are surely aiming for the same thing! I will believe in that, and continue to fight in the name of love and peace today and onwards…☆)
“♪～♪～♪”

Chapter 4

“♪～♪～♪”
(Now, it’s the “kuraimakusu”. The ninjas persistently try to steal the scroll. Even when they slip up and get caught, they manage to free themselves…)
(The ninjas run about, evading traps as they escape.)
(We samurai are exhausted, though. Why do we have to work so hard to hide the evidence of our master&#39;s affair…?)
(Those sorts of thoughts start to get us a little irritated.)
(On the way to the scroll, there is a rampage at a sake brewery, and alcohol is spilled. Everyone becomes inebriated and starts feeling tipsy.)
(So they hold a party… and while complaining about their masters, the ninjas and samurai somehow begin to get along well in their excitement.)
(In such a cheerful atmosphere, the sound of conch shells resounds, calling for war.)
(That&#39;s right... All of it was a scheme plotted by a neighboring country. They watched like tigers, waiting to attack the castle as soon as the opportunity presented itself.)
(They filled the wife’s head with words of the lord’s infidelity, cultivating her suspicion.)
(They prompted internal strife by splitting the castle in half.)
(They must have thought that if things went well, ninjas hired by his furious wife would simply assassinate the lord.)
(Even if it didn’t go that far, internal disputes would cause turmoil in the castle…)
(And because the ninjas had dismantled all of the traps and defenses, the castle is easier to attack.)
(Thus, due to the scheme, the national power was to be reduced, and the castle’s military strength to be further reduced with the infighting...)
(The castle was to be overrun by the approaching army of the neighboring country before we knew it.)
(However, well… the ninjas are so inept, that time has passed without any proper results...)
(So the army of the neighboring country becomes fed up with waiting, and begins their attack.)
(However, the castle had been thrown into disorder to some extent, causing confusion...)
(And while normally, it might have been possible to push through with momentum and take control of the castle…)
(A miscalculation occurs at that moment. In fact, if the castle lord truly was having an affair...)
(Then there would’ve been the likelihood that the wife, who wouldn’t listen to any excuse… would have had her entire force, which was half of the castle, defect against the lord.)

(Mm. The lord of the neighboring country seemed to be especially enamored with this castle lord’s wife...)
(It seems like he was planning to make this lord’s wife his own if things went well. That&#39;s why he told her about her husband&#39;s infidelity.)

(However, our lord was not having an affair. The scroll that was sealed in the secret room of the castle tower… The scroll that he had stubbornly tried to hide…)

(It was filled with a plethora of love poems written about his wife. A massive amount...)
(It seemed that he didn&#39;t want people to see them, so in his embarrassment, he tried to hide it.)
(After he reported this, the wife regrets suspecting his affair. The love between the lord and his wife deepens, and their vassals, ninjas and samurai, celebrate it with great joy.)
(The only hindrance left is the approach of the neighboring country’s army. The marauders who meddle with the happy ending — the love of a close couple…)

(... are destined to pay, and go crashing down into hell!)
“♪～♪～♪”
(Both the ninjas and samurai, exhausted from the slapstick drama, do their best to protect their beloved masters...)
(It’s a spectacular, legitimate performance of battle that vastly overshadows everything up to this point, that it makes you wonder “why were they acting so incompetent earlier, then?”)
(It&#39;s turning out as one would expect, but that&#39;s just the staple of period dramas!)
(Making good use of the traps that had harassed them up until this point, and having fought each other, the ninjas and samurai rampage perfectly in sync!)
(But the enemy is strong, and we are exhausted. One by one... My comrades fall, but I won’t back down!)
(As long as I have loyalty in my chest, my heart won’t break, even if my sword does!)


(As the last surviving young samurai, my arrows run out. My sword breaks. I fall… Then I pick up the sword of my great superior and stand once again.)
“Heaven’s vengeance is slow but sure!”
“You ruffians who can&#39;t read the room — if you don&#39;t fear my military might, come at me...!”

(Wow... As expected of Kanzaki-dono, he’s so dignified! It’s magnificent! It&#39;s a super duper cool, prominent show!)
(He truly is a sight to behold. However, the night sky is lonely when there is only the moon.)
(I, too, will accompany you! Even though I am in the shadows, I will fight to protect the peace of the people I love!)
“♪～♪～♪”
(There are only a few survivors from both the ninjas and samurai. Kanzaki-dono is fighting tooth-and-nail, but he won&#39;t be able to defeat the vast army by himself.)
(That&#39;s why we need to drive back the enemy in one move.)
(I’ll take on that task. I will sneak into the enemy camp unseen and cut off the head of the general.)
(If we defeat the leader, the enemy&#39;s army will either collapse or, at the very least, retreat. It will be our victory.)
(Everyone who has fallen before… their lives will not be in vain.)
(Up until now, I&#39;ve been an inexperienced ninja who only ever meekly follows everyone’s backs... That was my role, but now, I have a spotlight scene for myself right at the very end.)
(No, in fact… I always complain that it&#39;s embarrassing to stand out so much...)
(Yet I have a place to belong now, given to me by everyone in RYUSEITAI.)
(They allowed me to openly shout that I like the things I like.)
(And then welcomed me as a comrade. They let me spend my youth with them laughing, crying, and getting angry together.)
(If I were to run away from even that place... then that would truly be an embarrassment.)
(I&#39;m shy and spineless… If something scary happens again, I might cower back.)
(But for now, while a blade is put on my heart, I’ll face this adversity instead of running away.)
(Taichou-dono! Shinkai-dono! Tetora:-kun! Midori-kun! I was there the whole time, yet to others, it never seemed that way!)
(It never mattered to anyone whether I was there or not!)


(But it&#39;s completely different now! The five of us are RYUSEITAI! I&#39;m going to keep living on here, too!)
“♪～♪～♪”
(Watch me closely! This is my secret finishing move, Ninpou: Ring of Fire Passageway...!)
(Ahh, it&#39;s so fun and exhilarating!)
(I never thought something like this would ever come in handy in my whole life! Even Buddha never expected it, a-hahahaha…! ☆)


  
  
  
  
  

Translation Notes
↑ A reference to Pirate Festival.↑ It was more of the word of legends that ninjas would use kites for espionage, but they were used in ancient China for military purposes, among others. Kites were introduced from China to Japan in the seventh century. Read more here.↑ 起承転結 (kishoutenketsu) describes the structure of a narrative. In order, 起句 (kiku) is the introduction of characters and context, 承句 (sho) is the development of the story towards 転句 (ten) the twist, where the story takes an unexpected development, and finally 落ち (ketsu) the conclusion. 序破急 (johakyu) refers to the speed at which events happen. It's typically applied to tea ceremonies, marital arts, or theatre, but I thought the speed of music would better represent what he's talking about.↑ This resembles his 5* Scout quote from !-era.↑ RYUSEITAI (流星隊) means &quot;shooting star squadron&quot;, so the comet imagery has to do with that.↑ He's referring to himself, the Eccentrics, and the events of Meteor Impact. He uses the word ばけもの (bakemono), which were supernatural creatures that could shapeshift.↑ 武士道 (Bushido), or the &quot;way of the warrior&quot;, is the moral code of samurai which dictate the way they carry about their lives. Historically, there were several different codes and practices that samurai would follow, but Bushido can be used as a catch-all for the variety of them. Read more here.↑ Here, Shinobu uses 僕 (boku), a common masculine first-person pronoun, to refer to his old self. Shinobu's first-person pronoun is typically 拙者 (sessha, lit. clumsy person ), an archaic pronoun ninjas used. This whole line comes back in !!-era for Shinobu's Feature Scout story.↑ Souma finishes Shinobu's line. The full saying is from an Edo-era dodoitsu poem: &quot;People who meddle in other's love affairs will get kicked by a horse&quot;.↑ In the original Japanese text, Chiaki says this same line to AKATSUKI when they reunite in Submarine. Cute.↑ A shogi reference.↑ A ninja saying. The kanji for 忍 (ninja) is comprised of a 刃 (blade) on a 心 (heart). Conceptually, the two together represents the act of perserverence: even if there's a blade over their heart, they will get through. Now that's commitment to the bit. Read more here]]></content>
