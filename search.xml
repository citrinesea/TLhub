    Season: Spring


    Location: Garden Terrace


 Hello, Transfer Student-dono1. We’ve been seeing a lot of each other at “Gaaden Terasu” as of late, huh? Are you also having lunch?
Mm, food and health are inextricably linked.
I want you to eat a lot, get healthy, and produce us idols relentlessly…♪
As usual, I’m putting on the act as a chef. If you’d like, let me serve you some homemade food.
Also, I had so much fun chopping up the ingredients that I ended up preparing a lot of them...♪
Hm, that&#39;s what you intended? Because you want to save food costs? Hm, then there’s no need for my concern. Transfer Student-dono is such a strong woman!


 Splendid, bravo~♪ If you&#39;re happy with my cooking, I’d like you to eat it to your heart&#39;s content. May it become a source of energy for you!
Do you mind if I join you? It’s more pleasant to eat with a group~♪ Mm. Excuse me…
Hold on a moment. This is too much for one person to eat, but not enough for two people. Let’s finish cooking a little bit more.
Do you have any “reku-ests”? I’m getting tired of always eating seafood. I have some premium meat that Adonis-dono gave me, so maybe I’ll have that for t—…
Huh? — A scoundrel!

Eyaaa?! Wh-Wh– Why did a table get cut to pieces in front of me?!


I-I– I&#39;m definitely not a suspicious person! If you could just spare me my life…?!

Hm, who are you? What do you intend to do by sneaking around on the floor, you dodgy fellow?
Are you a thief? You lawless cad! For the sake of &quot;Gaaden Terasu&quot;, this Kanzaki Souma will inflict punishment upon you!

W-Wait a second! Why is this person wielding a Japanese sword as if it’s normal? This is a violation of the Firearms and Swords Act2!

Hmm, you are... I believe you are Sengoku from the Ninja Association. You. Are you acting suspicious again?
Good grief, it’s a complete nuisance. For some reason, people seem to think you’re close friends with me.

Huh, why? I&#39;m the type of ninja who doesn&#39;t have many close friends, though…
But it’s not that I can&#39;t make friends because I’m shy! Ninjas are like shadows, destined to live by erasing all traces of their very presence...!

Hmm. I’m samurai-like. You’re ninja-like. The public seems to think that samurai and ninja are birds of a feather.

Ehh!? Ninjas and samurai are completely different! But there were some ninjas who became feudal lords, so I guess it depends on the character of the region?
And um, Kanzaki-dono is more of a “swordsman” than a “samurai”, right?

Well, I&#39;m not interested in the distinction. However, the problem is that you and I are considered to be compatriots.
Whenever you do something strange, I get frowned upon, too. It’s better to live a more straightforward life, more pure and honest.
If you live right, instead of crawling around on the floor like that, you&#39;ll be able to face the sun with pride.


F-For some reason, I'm being scolded... Uu~? But I can’t relax in bright places, y’know~…?
… What on earth have you been doing since a while ago? You can eat while sitting on a chair. Ninjas seem like they’re completely unfamiliar with etiquette.
If you&#39;re hungry, I&#39;ll share some of my food with you.

Yaaay, I&#39;ve graduated from eating by myself~!
Ah, Transfer Student-dono was here too! I wonder if I&#39;ve interrupted your date...?

We’re simply “kurasumeito”. We just so happened to share a table today. Now that’s enough, it&#39;s time to eat. It&#39;s said that nausea dwells in an empty stomach.

Thank you, thank you...! I was running out of food allowance this month. Honestly, I was in trouble.
Also, here in Garden Terrace... I was doing a little fly-catching.


Well, now that I see it closely, it’s flypaper! You— Don&#39;t show those things while we’re eating! It’s unsanitary, I&#39;ll lose my appetite!
Are you going to eat it? Do you eat flies? As I thought, I can&#39;t understand ninjas...!

Hey, please don&#39;t draw your sword?! I’m not going to eat them~! These flies are meant to be frog food.

Fr-Frogs? Are you raising them as pets?

They’re more like friends than pets to raise~. Ninjas use dogs, birds, frogs, and the like.
But dogs bite, and birds nip with their beaks, so frogs are the best ones to get along with.
However, they&#39;re bigger eaters than they look. The cost of food is ridiculous, so that’s why I catch flies myself, if that makes sense...?

I-I see. That’s why you set foot for “Gaaden Terasu”. Certainly, those types of insects tend to gather in the dining hall.

That’s right~ Oops, found another fly! I&#39;ll capture it~☆

Don&#39;t mess around while you’re eating! Have you no manners!

Forgive me a million times over, but I&#39;m seriously in trouble. I can&#39;t let my frogs go hungry...
I&#39;m starving because I&#39;m cutting back on my own food expenses. Ninjas and samurai alike cannot fight if they are hungry.
So please give me your patience— hm hm! There are flies again~☆

Hey, that&#39;s annoying! Besides, flies have compound eyes. They have excellent dynamic vision, so you can&#39;t catch them with movements like that! Watch!
En garde–!3

Ooh, you caught a fly with chopsticks! That’s amazing...☆


Hehe. I don&#39;t try to pretend I’m as skilled as the ancient swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, but... for a well-trained martial artist, a target such as this is a breeze before breakfast. Ha! Take that! And that4!

Wow, that’s amazing! I want you to catch more, and I want you to teach me how to do it, too~♪

Heh, I don&#39;t hate being praised. But my training will be severe, you know.

Bring it on! Enduring all hardships is what makes a ninja—...
Ow?!


Ogh?! Wh-Why are you hitting us, Transfer Student-dono!
Huh, “Don&#39;t fool around while eating”...? That&#39;s right, this ninja managed to get me carried away!

Is it my fault?!
But well, I certainly don&#39;t think it would be a good idea to play with flies while we eat! Forgive me, Transfer Student-dono!

Hehe. Sengoku, you also call Transfer Student-dono &quot;Transfer Student-dono&quot;, huh?
It gives off the impression that we are samurai and ninja who serve the same master, so what say you and I get along better from now on?

I&#39;m so happy! Yaaay, I&#39;ve made a new friend... ♪ Transfer Student-dono brought us together!
I’m so thankful, I should call you “Lord&quot;5 instead of “Transfer Student-dono”! You are our master, Lord!

Lord, why have you stopped eating? Come come, eat as much as you like～♪

Lord～♪

Lord～☆


...Ow?! You hit me again! I suppose you’d rather be called “Princess” instead of “Lord”?

Hmm, a girl&#39;s heart is complicated...
Sengoku, if you&#39;re having trouble finding food for your frogs, come to the Marine Life Club room later. We may have some food stocked up, so I&#39;ll lend you a little.

Uwaa, that&#39;d save me trouble! But it&#39;s cool to catch flies with chopsticks too. I&#39;d be happy if you could teach me how to do it later~♪
Ehehe, I had a really fun lunchtime today! I am terribly grateful~♪


  
  
  
  
Translation Notes
↑ -殿 (-dono) is an honorific that roughly means &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;. It's archaic, which gives Souma and Shinobu an old-timey feel.↑ Very strict regulations on the possession and use of firearms and swords in Japan.↑ ちぇすと is an exclamation. Souma says it a lot when he lunges with his sword.↑ &quot;とりゃ！せいや!&quot; are more exclamations from martial arts like judo. They can be used when throwing something/someone heavy, or intimidating the opponent.↑ They're using 殿 (dono) by itself here.]]></content>

    Season: Summer


    Location: Starmony Dorm Commons


 (... I know that singing and dancing aren’t the only jobs an idol does, but I never thought I&#39;d have to perform an ikebana1 demonstration)
(As Rhythm Link’s representative, I have to make sure I present something that doesn’t bring shame to the agency.)

…… all done~♪

 Really? I haven’t even put together the main materials yet. Do you have experience in this, by any chance—-
…… Shinkai. What is that?

what do you mean? it’s [ikebana], of course. from the school of [shinkai]2……☆

 There’s no helping you. Don’t claim to be a school as you please. No matter how you look at it, all you did was stick a fish onto the needle bed.
We’re arranging flowers, not fish. This is beyond unacceptable. As STAR PRO’s representative, don’t you feel the least bit shameful?

mmph… the only people who get to decide whether my [arrangement] is [acceptable] are the [beholders]. not you, [temple guy].☆
is it [bad] if I don’t follow the [model]? if that’s the only way to get [recognized], that’s a little boring, isn’t it?
anyway, I’ve grown tired of [ikebana], so i’m done here. i’m going to go [soak] in the [pond]……♪

….. What an uninhibited guy. He does realize that this would make it a “coral arrangement”, not a “floral arrangement”, right?3
(But Shinkai has a point. It’d be hard to say that it’s my work if I just stick to the textbook.)
(However, you should only be creative and break the rules after you’ve learned them. If you take it on with your own style while you’re inexperienced, you’ll end up with a ridiculous work of art.)
(Before anything else, I’ve got to thoroughly drill the basics in my head.)



    One hour later

(…… Hmm. This should be good enough for now.)
(But it looks just like the picture in the textbook……)

Hello. Are you doing ikebana? What an unusual hobby~

Not quite. I’m going to be participating in a flower-arranging demonstration. This is just practice.

I see. And this is… a fish arrangement? Is this your work too, Keito-kun?

That would be Shinkai’s work. It stinks, as you’d expect from fish… It doesn’t look like he’ll be coming back either. I’ll have to go put this in the kitchen.
That&#39;s right. Aoba, if you don&#39;t mind, could you give me your thoughts on my work? I can&#39;t really judge it for myself.

My thoughts? Mmnnn~ I think it looks nice, but…

Don’t hold back. I want your honest opinion.

No, it&#39;s not that I’m holding back. I just don&#39;t know much about ikebana. I know a lot about flower meanings, though.
Could I try it too? I feel like I could evaluate your work properly if I try it myself.

Hmm. They do say that teaching is the best way to learn……

(Sniff sniff)…  I thought it smelled like flowers here. It was you guys, huh?.

Ah, good afternoon. How about you join us, Ogami-kun?

Ehhh…?



    Another hour later

— And now for the arrangement. Place the flowers so that they fill in the gaps between the ones you just inserted.

In the gaps, got it~

Gaaaaah! I jumped in ‘cuz it looked interesting, but it’s taking forever! What a pain~!
I mean, it&#39;s not rock ‘n roll to fit into the mold! I’m just gonna be me, like this, this ‘n — this!
How’s that, Hasumi-senpai! This looks way more like an UNDEAD flower stand now. Cool, dontcha think~♪

First it was Shinkai, now it’s you… You’re truly hopeless…… We’re making flower arrangements, not flower stands.

I&#39;m baaack. Hah~, I&#39;m tired……
Aoba-onii-chan, you’re holding something nice, huh. Gimme that rose~♪

Of course, here you are.

Thank you. (Nibble nibble)…

— Y-You ate it?!

I didn’t eat it. I just wanted to get energy from the rose~4
Are you all playing with flowers together? How peaceful...

It’s ikebana. Come to think of it, aren’t you also making an appearance on the show?

Making an appearance.... Ah, that variety show. I see, so that’s why you’re doing this.
I don’t think they expect us to be proficient at it, so do we really need to practice?
We were invited to do our part as idols, so making the screen lively is enough, right?
Kei-chan, your stamina has its bounds, right? If you give anything and everything your all, one of these days you’re going to collapse.

Hmm. It’s a reasonable point.
But in order to leave a good mark, I intend to put my entire heart and soul into the task. Rhythm Link is already packed with top veterans, after all.
I’ll perform well so they’ll ask me to return. This is just me laying the groundwork in order to break into semi-regular status.

Hmm…… Well, I guess I&#39;ll join you guys and have some fun with the flowers, too. You&#39;ll probably improve if you have a rival...
And as NEW DI’s representative, I can&#39;t just stand by and watch…...♪

Hmph, do whatever you like. You&#39;re probably more of a natural at this sort of thing than I am, but...
Hard work will not betray me. I’ll have the last laugh.


  
  
  
  
Translation Notes
↑ Ikebana (生け花, lit. giving life to flowers) is the art of Japanese flower arrangement. Read about its principles and relationship with Buddhism here↑ Schools pass on the art of ikebana to students. Each individual school follows a particular set of principles, philosophies, and arranging techniques, all which vary depending on the school. Matching the name format of (school)-ryu (流), Kanata calls it 深海流 (School of Shinkai).↑ Originally, he says 生け花、生け魚 (flower arrangement, fish arrangement), but since it rhymed (hana, sakana), I wanted to preserve his pun.↑ A good reference for this is this Ritsu card from Fleur de Lis]]></content>
