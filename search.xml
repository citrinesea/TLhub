    Season: Spring


    Location: Starmony Dorm Commons

 (... I know that singing and dancing aren’t the only jobs an idol does, but I never thought I&#39;d have to perform an ikebana1 demonstration)
(As Rhythm Link’s representative, I have to make sure I present something that doesn’t bring shame to the agency.)

…… all done~♪
 Really? I haven’t even put together the main materials yet. Do you have experience in this, by any chance—-

…… Shinkai. What is that?
what do you mean? it’s [ikebana], of course. from the school of [shinkai]2……☆
 There’s no helping you. Don’t claim to be a school as you please. No matter how you look at it, all you did was stick a fish onto the needle bed.

We’re arranging flowers, not fish. This is beyond unacceptable. As STAR PRO’s representative, don’t you feel the least bit shameful?
mmph… the only people who get to decide whether my [arrangement] is [acceptable] are the [beholders]. not you, [temple guy].☆

is it [bad] if I don’t follow the [model]? if that’s the only way to get [recognized], that’s a little boring, isn’t it?

anyway, I’ve grown tired of [ikebana], so i’m done here. i’m going to go [soak] in the [pond]……♪
….. What an uninhibited guy. He does realize that this would make it a “coral arrangement”, not a “floral arrangement”, right?3

(But Shinkai has a point. It’d be hard to say that it’s my work if I just stick to the textbook.)
(However, you should only be creative and break the rules after you’ve learned them. If you take it on with your own style while you’re inexperienced, you’ll end up with a ridiculous work of art.)
(Before anything else, I’ve got to thoroughly drill the basics in my head.)


    One hour later

(…… Hmm. This should be good enough for now.)
(But it looks just like the picture in the textbook……)

Hello. Are you doing ikebana? What an unusual hobby~
Not quite. I’m going to be participating in a flower-arranging demonstration. This is just practice.
I see. And this is… a fish arrangement? Is this your work too, Keito-kun?
That would be Shinkai’s work. It stinks, as you’d expect from fish… It doesn’t look like he’ll be coming back either. I’ll have to go put this in the kitchen.

That's right. Aoba, if you don't mind, could you give me your thoughts on my work? I can't really judge it for myself.
My thoughts? Mmnnn~ I think it looks nice, but…
Don’t hold back. I want your honest opinion.
No, it's not that I’m holding back. I just don't know much about ikebana. I know a lot about flower meanings, though.
Could I try it too? I feel like I could evaluate your work properly if I try it myself.
Hmm. They do say that teaching is the best way to learn……
(Sniff sniff)…  I thought it smelled like flowers here. It was you guys, huh?.
Ah, good afternoon. How about you join us, Ogami-kun?
Ehhh…?
Translation Notes
 
↑ Ikebana (生け花, lit. giving life to flowers) is the art of Japanese flower arrangement. Read about its principles and relationship with Buddhism here↑ Schools pass on the art of ikebana to students. Each individual school follows a particular set of principles, philosophies, and arranging techniques, all which vary depending on the school. Matching the name format of (school)-ryu (流), Kanata calls it 深海流 (School of Shinkai).↑ Originally, he says 生け花、生け魚 (flower arrangement, fish arrangement), but since it rhymed (hana, sakana), I wanted to preserve his pun.↑ A good reference for this is this Ritsu card from Fleur de Lis
