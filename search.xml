In this campaign, you get to narrow down your favorite idols to a singular "oshi": your favorite. The following translation has: the keywords and filters used for the idol selection screen, Q&A responses and charts, and the phone calls you receive after choosing your 3 top idols. Additionally, the "Surging Wave Invitation Campaign" classfications are added to the filter (watch the videos here).

Interviews
 Where would you go on a first date?
 A manga museum. I&#39;d like to show you my favorite works, but if we can&#39;t read them all in one day, we can come back another time.

 How about window-shoppin’? We won&#39;t run outta things to talk about when we’re lookin’ at all the different shops and goods. We can find out each other’s taste in fashion and what sorta trends are hot, too.

 What about a “cat ka-fay”? Cats look so adorable, just seeing them is sure to make the two of us smile...~♪

 I’d like to go to a theme park! ‘Cuz there’s all sortsa things we could do there together, like going on a buncha rides, buying souvenirs, and so much more~♪

 I think it’d be fun anywhere, as long as I’m with the person I love, but… For me, it’d be even more fun if we’re at a place that has yuruchara.

 I would love an opportunity to lead the way around a ninja village! I want to show you all there is to know about my favorite thing! Be it by witnessing ninjutsu, having a first-hand experience with it, or anything else of the like~♪

 A date means going to the amusement park! There’s roller coasters, the ferris wheel, and most importantly, hero shows! The day would pass by in a flash! ☆

 on warm days, i would like to have fun at the [ocean]~ and in the colder seasons, we can visit the [aquarium]...♪
 What was the last message exchange you had with someone in your unit?
 I contacted Kiryu and Kanzaki about our work schedules, but neither of them responded. Well, that isn’t unusual, though.?

 I wanted to hear what their plans were for our new song, so I hit ‘em up. After that, we ended up meetin&#39; up and talkin&#39; face-to-face.“Gaaden Terasu” as of late, huh? Are you also having lunch?

 I hadn&#39;t realized I&#39;d sent an incomprehensible string of characters, so I contacted my seniors to apologize. Handling a &quot;sumaho&quot; is difficult…

 I messaged everyone ‘bout when we’ll have our next practice session together! Midori-kun’s the only one who hasn’t responded yet, so I’m just gonna go and ask him directly!

 My parents gave me lots of vegetables, so I asked everyone in my unit if they’d like some before I offered them to anyone else. I’ll carry some with me later.

 Tetora-kun sent me our schedule for the practice session, so I replied to that! I’m in charge of booking us a practice room~♪

 I got my hands on some ninja-themed sentai merchandise, so I couldn’t help but message Sengoku about it. It made me happy to get a text praising how cool it looks! ☆

 i messaged chiaki that i am at the [ocean]. he gets [worried] when i do not tell him [where] i am.
 Why are you so cool?
 It&#39;s because of the support and encouragement around me. My friends and allies are the reason I can stand on stage and strive for greater heights.

 I guess it&#39;s ‘cuz AKATSUKI is where I can be with Hasumi ‘n Kanzaki. When I see those two honest guys, it’s like my spine just straightens up on its own.

 There&#39;s something about that comment that makes me feel bashful. However, I&#39;m pleased if my daily training has led to that kind of impression.

 Maybe it’s ‘cuz everyone’s always supporting me? Also, if you think my constant hard work towards my goal is somethin’ “cool”, then I’m real happy ‘bout that!

 I don’t really know how to answer that… But I think that it’s thanks to my parents that I was born with this face, so I’ll express my gratitude to them later…

 I-I’m cool? It surprises me to hear that, but I’d certainly be glad if you consider ninjas to be something cool!

 It might be because I dream of becoming a hero. And not just any hero, but a “cool” one…☆

 it is because there are so many [cool] people around me~ so maybe i am also more likely to be seen as cool along with them…?
 What are your best subjects?
 You could say that liberal arts as a whole are my strongpoint. I believe I&#39;ve not only excelled in Japanese language and history, but also in civics.

 I&#39;m good at sewin’ and cookin’, so home economics is my forte. I usually suck at studying the classic way... especially math; it hurts my head.

 I enjoy classical literature and Japanese history. On the contrary, I am not as good at English and world history. While I improve on my current abilities, I want to overcome my weaknesses too.

 I’m confident with my practical classes, like P.E. and home economics~♪ I wanna get better at theory-based subjects too, but it’s pretty difficult for me…

 Math’s my best subject, or more like, it’s the only thing I can do…? I’m not at all good with other subjects, so I think I’m pretty compatible with it.

 I’ve got a bit of confidence when it comes to Japanese history! I studied a whole lot to make myself well-versed with the era of ninjas~♪

 My best subjects are the liberal arts, like Japanese literature and language! And my weakest subject is math. I would always study until late at night before a test for that class.

 [history] and [biology] might be my best subjects? well, i say [biology], but i actually mean [marine] biology...♪
 What’s the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?
 I try to set aside the time for meditation. Not only does it improve my ability to concentrate and relax, but it seems to have a positive effect on creativity too.

 A while ago, I fell asleep with the light on in my room. Guess that’s why the first thing I do when I get up is to check if they’re still on.

 I prepare breakfast. Now that I have a new kitchen knife, I look forward to cooking with it every day~♪

 I heard it was good for your health if you drink a glass of water in the morning, so I do that. After that, I go out for my morning training routine.

 I play a yuruchara game on my phone. That’s the best way to spend time whenever you wanna lie in bed for a little longer, yeah?

 I try to do exercises that help you grow taller. I hope it works out, even if I only grow a tiny bit more~

 I begin my day with a fresh start by doing radio exercises!1 I get to move every muscle in my body in an efficient manner, and it also feels really good to refresh my mind and body first thing in the morning!

 i have new [fishies] in my room’s [water tanks], so i [check] how they are doing when i [greet] them~♪
Oshi Calls
 Keito Hasumi

 “This is Hasumi Keito from AKATSUKI. To put it bluntly, I’m wondering if you’ll choose me as your “oshi”.”
“Er, I’m sorry if I caught you off guard. If I hope to be chosen, I should probably talk more about my charm in my own words. Well then…”
“As AKATSUKI’s leader, I build up experience as an idol day by day. I work hard to make sure AKATSUKI evolves until everyone knows who we are as a unit.”
“Also…… Well, it’d be a long story if I were to go on. I’ll strive to give it my all, and let my work speak for itself. Keep your eyes on me, and see for yourself if I’m worthy of being your “oshi”.”

 Kuro Kiryu

 “Yo, I’m Kiryu Kuro. I work as part of AKATSUKI.”
“I&#39;m not really used to sellin’ myself, but this is a great opportunity. I gotta make sure you get to know a li’l bit about me.”
“The thing I&#39;m good at is sewin’. I make costumes for AKATSUKI, but I also stitch up outfits for other people if they request it. So, well, guess you could say I&#39;m good with my hands.”
“I dunno if if I did a good job showin’ off my good points…… but if you choose to support me, I&#39;ll repay it in full. If it’s fine with you, come along with me.”

 Souma Kanzaki

 “Ohhh, it connected~♪ I presume that you must be the “aidoru fan”. I am Kanzaki Souma, It’s a pleasure to meet you!”
“I am an “aidoru” who is a member of the “yunitto” AKATSUKI. As the descendant of a samurai clan, I’ve a sword on one side and a mindfulness of “tii-pii-ooh”2 on the other!”
“...... To tell you the truth, I’m not sure I understand what being someone’s “oshi” really entails yet. However, I imagine it’s similar to a samurai’s pledge of devotion to their lord.”
“I’ll show you that I’m a splendid “aidoru” worthy of your support. I hope that you will cheer for me….~♪”

 Tetora Nagumo

 “Ossu, I’m Nagumo Tetora! I’m in STARMAKER PRODUCTION’s RYUSEITAI!”
&quot;My hobby is doing workouts like weight-training, and my specialty is cooking the manliest food over an open flame. I’m always in the thick of it, working hard and growing in order to become a man among men~♪&quot;
“No matter what hardship knocks me down, I’ll show you that I can stand right back up and overcome it all. That’s how I wanna move forward as an idol too, step by step!”
“I’ll definitely become an idol so great, you’ll be glad that you chose me, so… I hope that you can support me…!”

 Midori Takamine

 “I’m Takamine Midori from RYUSEITAI. Umm, I’m not too sure what to talk about here, but I’ll try…”
“My family runs a greengrocer business, and I help them out often. Because of that, I like vegetables quite a bit… Ah, but the thing I love most is yuruchara~♪”
“On the other hand, I have a lot of things I’m not a fan of… Ah, but maybe I shouldn’t mention those right now. I’m sorry, I always get negative so easily…”
“I haven’t shown much appeal at all, but I’ll do as best as I can in my own way, so… If it’s alright, I’d be happy to have your support…♪”

 Shinobu Sengoku

 “I’m Sengoku Shinobu, a member of RYUSEITAI! I’m a ‘ninja’, so I devote myself to training and discipline day after day.”
“It’s difficult to explain in a few words why I chose to be a ninja, but… From a young age, I have always admired the ninja’s way of life, and so I aspired to become one myself~♪”
“Ninjas may be ones who conceal themselves, but I’m not simply a ninja — I’m an idol as well! So I always put everything I have acquired in my ninja training to good use, even on stage!”
“It would make me happy if you watched my acrobatic performances, and chose me as your ‘oshi’~♪”

 Chiaki Morisawa

 “The hero of justice, Morisawa Chiaki—! Has just made his arrival! …Mhm, I got that pose down perfectly! ☆”
“Alongside my comrades in RYUSEITAI, I work hard in my activities every day, both as a hero and as an idol!”
“I want to make everyone smile, and that feeling is stronger and more passionate than anyone else’s. I strive to always keep it that way. And the source of that burning passion is none other than the encouraging cheers of our fans!”
“That’s why I’d like you to send me your support by calling for my name as loud as you can! I’m counting on you!”

 Kanata Shinkai

 “hello~♪ i am shinkai kanata from ryuseitai.”
“i love the ocean, so i often take walks on the [beach] and [bathe] in [water]. i also love [fishies]~♪”

”to give your life a plentiful amount of [replenishment] as well, i will deliver many [songs] to you.”

“so i would love it if you would cheer for me. puka, puka…♪”

    Season: Spring


    Location: Garden Terrace


 Hello, Transfer Student-dono1. We’ve been seeing a lot of each other at “Gaaden Terasu” as of late, huh? Are you also having lunch?
Mm, food and health are inextricably linked.
I want you to eat a lot, get healthy, and produce us idols relentlessly…♪
As usual, I’m putting on the act as a chef. If you’d like, let me serve you some homemade food.
Also, I had so much fun chopping up the ingredients that I ended up preparing a lot of them...♪
Hm, that&#39;s what you intended? Because you want to save food costs? Hm, then there’s no need for my concern. Transfer Student-dono is such a strong woman!


 Splendid, bravo~♪ If you&#39;re happy with my cooking, I’d like you to eat it to your heart&#39;s content. May it become a source of energy for you!
Do you mind if I join you? It’s more pleasant to eat with a group~♪ Mm. Excuse me…
Hold on a moment. This is too much for one person to eat, but not enough for two people. Let’s finish cooking a little bit more.
Do you have any “reku-ests”? I’m getting tired of always eating seafood. I have some premium meat that Adonis-dono gave me, so maybe I’ll have that for t—…
Huh? — A scoundrel!

Eyaaa?! Wh-Wh– Why did a table get cut to pieces in front of me?!


I-I– I&#39;m definitely not a suspicious person! If you could just spare me my life…?!

Hm, who are you? What do you intend to do by sneaking around on the floor, you dodgy fellow?
Are you a thief? You lawless cad! For the sake of &quot;Gaaden Terasu&quot;, this Kanzaki Souma will inflict punishment upon you!

W-Wait a second! Why is this person wielding a Japanese sword as if it’s normal? This is a violation of the Firearms and Swords Act2!

Hmm, you are... I believe you are Sengoku from the Ninja Association. You. Are you acting suspicious again?
Good grief, it’s a complete nuisance. For some reason, people seem to think you’re close friends with me.

Huh, why? I&#39;m the type of ninja who doesn&#39;t have many close friends, though…
But it’s not that I can&#39;t make friends because I’m shy! Ninjas are like shadows, destined to live by erasing all traces of their very presence...!

Hmm. I’m samurai-like. You’re ninja-like. The public seems to think that samurai and ninja are birds of a feather.

Ehh!? Ninjas and samurai are completely different! But there were some ninjas who became feudal lords, so I guess it depends on the character of the region?
And um, Kanzaki-dono is more of a “swordsman” than a “samurai”, right?

Well, I&#39;m not interested in the distinction. However, the problem is that you and I are considered to be compatriots.
Whenever you do something strange, I get frowned upon, too. It’s better to live a more straightforward life, more pure and honest.
If you live right, instead of crawling around on the floor like that, you&#39;ll be able to face the sun with pride.


F-For some reason, I'm being scolded... Uu~? But I can’t relax in bright places, y’know~…?
… What on earth have you been doing since a while ago? You can eat while sitting on a chair. Ninjas seem like they’re completely unfamiliar with etiquette.
If you&#39;re hungry, I&#39;ll share some of my food with you.

Yaaay, I&#39;ve graduated from eating by myself~!
Ah, Transfer Student-dono was here too! I wonder if I&#39;ve interrupted your date...?

We’re simply “kurasumeito”. We just so happened to share a table today. Now that’s enough, it&#39;s time to eat. It&#39;s said that nausea dwells in an empty stomach.

Thank you, thank you...! I was running out of food allowance this month. Honestly, I was in trouble.
Also, here in Garden Terrace... I was doing a little fly-catching.


Well, now that I see it closely, it’s flypaper! You— Don&#39;t show those things while we’re eating! It’s unsanitary, I&#39;ll lose my appetite!
Are you going to eat it? Do you eat flies? As I thought, I can&#39;t understand ninjas...!

Hey, please don&#39;t draw your sword?! I’m not going to eat them~! These flies are meant to be frog food.

Fr-Frogs? Are you raising them as pets?

They’re more like friends than pets to raise~ Ninjas use dogs, birds, frogs, and the like.
But dogs bite, and birds nip with their beaks, so frogs are the best ones to get along with.
However, they&#39;re bigger eaters than they look. The cost of food is ridiculous, so that’s why I catch flies myself, if that makes sense...?

I-I see. That’s why you set foot for “Gaaden Terasu”. Certainly, those types of insects tend to gather in the dining hall.

That’s right~ Oops, found another fly! I&#39;ll capture it~☆

Don&#39;t mess around while you’re eating! Have you no manners!

Forgive me a million times over, but I&#39;m seriously in trouble. I can&#39;t let my frogs go hungry...
I&#39;m starving because I&#39;m cutting back on my own food expenses. Ninjas and samurai alike cannot fight if they are hungry.
So please give me your patience— hm hm! There are flies again~☆

Hey, that&#39;s annoying! Besides, flies have compound eyes. They have excellent dynamic vision, so you can&#39;t catch them with movements like that! Watch!
En garde–!3

Ooh, you caught a fly with chopsticks! That’s amazing...☆


Hehe. I don&#39;t try to pretend I’m as skilled as the ancient swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, but... for a well-trained martial artist, a target such as this is a breeze before breakfast. Ha! Take that! And that4!

Wow, that’s amazing! I want you to catch more, and I want you to teach me how to do it, too~♪

Heh, I don&#39;t hate being praised. But my training will be severe, you know.

Bring it on! Enduring all hardships is what makes a ninja—...
Ow?!


Ogh?! Wh-Why are you hitting us, Transfer Student-dono!
Huh, “Don&#39;t fool around while eating”...? That&#39;s right, this ninja managed to get me carried away!

Is it my fault?!
But well, I certainly don&#39;t think it would be a good idea to play with flies while we eat! Forgive me, Transfer Student-dono!

Hehe. Sengoku, you also call Transfer Student-dono &quot;Transfer Student-dono&quot;, huh?
It gives off the impression that we are samurai and ninja who serve the same master, so what say you and I get along better from now on?

I&#39;m so happy! Yaaay, I&#39;ve made a new friend... ♪ Transfer Student-dono brought us together!
I’m so thankful, I should call you “Lord&quot;5 instead of “Transfer Student-dono”! You are our master, Lord!

Lord, why have you stopped eating? Come come, eat as much as you like～♪

Lord～♪

Lord～☆


...Ow?! You hit me again! I suppose you’d rather be called “Princess” instead of “Lord”?

Hmm, a girl&#39;s heart is complicated...
Sengoku, if you&#39;re having trouble finding food for your frogs, come to the Marine Life Club room later. We may have some food stocked up, so I&#39;ll lend you a little.

Uwaa, that&#39;d save me trouble! But it&#39;s cool to catch flies with chopsticks too. I&#39;d be happy if you could teach me how to do it later~♪
Ehehe, I had a really fun lunchtime today! I am terribly grateful~♪


  
  
  
  
Translation Notes
↑ -殿 (-dono) is an honorific that roughly means &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;. It's archaic, which gives Souma and Shinobu an old-timey feel.↑ Very strict regulations on the possession and use of firearms and swords in Japan.↑ ちぇすと is an exclamation. Souma says it a lot when he lunges with his sword.↑ &quot;とりゃ！せいや!&quot; are more exclamations from martial arts like judo. They can be used when throwing something/someone heavy, or intimidating the opponent.↑ They're using 殿 (dono) by itself here.]]></content>

    Season: Summer


    Location: Starmony Dorm Commons


 (... I know that singing and dancing aren’t the only jobs an idol does, but I never thought I&#39;d have to perform an ikebana1 demonstration)
(As Rhythm Link’s representative, I have to make sure I present something that doesn’t bring shame to the agency.)

…… all done~♪

 Really? I haven’t even put together the main materials yet. Do you have experience in this, by any chance—-
…… Shinkai. What is that?

what do you mean? it’s [ikebana], of course. from the school of [shinkai]2……☆

 There’s no helping you. Don’t claim to be a school as you please. No matter how you look at it, all you did was stick a fish onto the needle bed.
We’re arranging flowers, not fish. This is beyond unacceptable. As STAR PRO’s representative, don’t you feel the least bit shameful?

mmph… the only people who get to decide whether my [arrangement] is [acceptable] are the [beholders]. not you, [temple guy].☆
is it [bad] if I don’t follow the [model]? if that’s the only way to get [recognized], that’s a little boring, isn’t it?
anyway, I’ve grown tired of [ikebana], so i’m done here. i’m going to go [soak] in the [pond]……♪

….. What an uninhibited guy. He does realize that this would make it a “coral arrangement”, not a “floral arrangement”, right?3
(But Shinkai has a point. It’d be hard to say that it’s my work if I just stick to the textbook.)
(However, you should only be creative and break the rules after you’ve learned them. If you take it on with your own style while you’re inexperienced, you’ll end up with a ridiculous work of art.)
(Before anything else, I’ve got to thoroughly drill the basics in my head.)



    One hour later

(…… Hmm. This should be good enough for now.)
(But it looks just like the picture in the textbook……)

Hello. Are you doing ikebana? What an unusual hobby~

Not quite. I’m going to be participating in a flower-arranging demonstration. This is just practice.

I see. And this is… a fish arrangement? Is this your work too, Keito-kun?

That would be Shinkai’s work. It stinks, as you’d expect from fish… It doesn’t look like he’ll be coming back either. I’ll have to go put this in the kitchen.
That&#39;s right. Aoba, if you don&#39;t mind, could you give me your thoughts on my work? I can&#39;t really judge it for myself.

My thoughts? Mmnnn~ I think it looks nice, but…

Don’t hold back. I want your honest opinion.

No, it&#39;s not that I’m holding back. I just don&#39;t know much about ikebana. I know a lot about flower meanings, though.
Could I try it too? I feel like I could evaluate your work properly if I try it myself.

Hmm. They do say that teaching is the best way to learn……

(Sniff sniff)…  I thought it smelled like flowers here. It was you guys, huh?.

Ah, good afternoon. How about you join us, Ogami-kun?

Ehhh…?



    Another hour later

— And now for the arrangement. Place the flowers so that they fill in the gaps between the ones you just inserted.

In the gaps, got it~

Gaaaaah! I jumped in ‘cuz it looked interesting, but it’s taking forever! What a pain~!
I mean, it&#39;s not rock ‘n roll to fit into the mold! I’m just gonna be me, like this, this ‘n — this!
How’s that, Hasumi-senpai! This looks way more like an UNDEAD flower stand now. Cool, dontcha think~♪

First it was Shinkai, now it’s you… You’re truly hopeless…… We’re making flower arrangements, not flower stands.

I&#39;m baaack. Hah~, I&#39;m tired……
Aoba-onii-chan, you’re holding something nice, huh. Gimme that rose~♪

Of course, here you are.

Thank you. (Nibble nibble)…

— Y-You ate it?!

I didn’t eat it. I just wanted to get energy from the rose~4
Are you all playing with flowers together? How peaceful...

It’s ikebana. Come to think of it, aren’t you also making an appearance on the show?

Making an appearance.... Ah, that variety show. I see, so that’s why you’re doing this.
I don’t think they expect us to be proficient at it, so do we really need to practice?
We were invited to do our part as idols, so making the screen lively is enough, right?
Kei-chan, your stamina has its bounds, right? If you give anything and everything your all, one of these days you’re going to collapse.

Hmm. It’s a reasonable point.
But in order to leave a good mark, I intend to put my entire heart and soul into the task. Rhythm Link is already packed with top veterans, after all.
I’ll perform well so they’ll ask me to return. This is just me laying the groundwork in order to break into semi-regular status.

Hmm…… Well, I guess I&#39;ll join you guys and have some fun with the flowers, too. You&#39;ll probably improve if you have a rival...
And as NEW DI’s representative, I can&#39;t just stand by and watch…...♪

Hmph, do whatever you like. You&#39;re probably more of a natural at this sort of thing than I am, but...
Hard work will not betray me. I’ll have the last laugh.


  
  
  
  
Translation Notes
↑ Ikebana (生け花, lit. giving life to flowers) is the art of Japanese flower arrangement. Read about its principles and relationship with Buddhism here↑ Schools pass on the art of ikebana to students. Each individual school follows a particular set of principles, philosophies, and arranging techniques, all which vary depending on the school. Matching the name format of (school)-ryu (流), Kanata calls it 深海流 (School of Shinkai).↑ Originally, he says 生け花、生け魚 (flower arrangement, fish arrangement), but since it rhymed (hana, sakana), I wanted to preserve his pun.↑ A good reference for this is this Ritsu card from Fleur de Lis]]></content>
